            "desc": "First of all I would like to confirm that You made a right choice if you have bought this phone.\n\nWhile decided to buy a new phone i was so confused between the Moto G (2nd Gen) and ASUS ZenFone 5 (16GB).\n\nAfter doing a lot of research online i found Asus ZenFone 5 Battery is not good when you use 3G Internet or Play Games.\n\nSo Here I am not going to share the specification of this phone rather i will focus on some hidden features and known issues and their solutions.\n\nFOR YOUR INFORMATION:\n1) This phone support 3g network in only SIM Slot 1.\n2) No File Manager installed (You need to download ES File Explorer from Play Store)\n3) Simple Stock UI result in Smooth performance.\n4) No Lags at all.\n5) Guaranteed Android and Security Updates for 18 Months.\n6) Battery average (12 Hour Backup with wifi and 3g network on, 1 hour of internet surfing, 30 minutes of gaming, 1 hour of whatsapp, 2 hour of music, some phone calls and 10 minutes of camera use).\n7) Fast Startup & ShutDown.\n8) Premium Look and Display.\n\nTHINGS TO DO AFTER BUYING THIS PHONE?\n1) Go to Settings>>About Phone and tap 5 times on Build number to enable developer mode.\n2) Go to Settings>>Developer options and Select runtime: Use ART. This will help you save more ram and longer battery life. Doing this will ask you restart the phone.. it may take some times depends on the number of apps you have installed. (You will not lose any of your apps.)\n3) Once ART runtime mode is enabled, again navigate to Settings>>Developer options and UNcheck Don't keep activities.. This will help you if you do multitasking.\nNote: Do not use ART runtime if you restart your phone very frequently as everytime it will take time to optimize apps on the startup.\n4) Disable System Apps if you don't use them. For me these includes: Drive, Email, Gmail, Google Korean Keyboard, Google Pinyin Input, Google Play Books, Google Play Games, Google Play Movies, Google Play Newsstand, Google+, Maps, Motorola Alert, Motorola Migrate.\nNote: You may install K-9 mail as default mail app. i am sure you are gonna love it. Dont forget to disable sync and notifications.\n\nKNOWN ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS\n1) This phone lacks an option for WCDMA ONLY mode. To force stay on 3g network, Download \"NETWORK\" by \"PHILIPP MANGELOW\" from play store and select WCDMA ONLY.\n2) Notification Bar does not contain quick toggle and it redirects you to the setting menu. To enable quick toggle in notification bar, Download \"NOTIFICATION TOGGLE\" by \"J4VELIN\" from Play Store and customize it according to your needs. There is an option for radio toggles too, so if you install this app then you do not need to install NETWORK from play store.\n3) If your music sound goes wired on full volume then use 320 KBPS Original Music files only and / or Go to Settings>>Sound>>Audio Effect and Turn it OFF.\n\nTIPS AND TRICKS\n1) Before installing any application, make sure you read all the permission ask by the app developer.\n2) Never ever install TrueCaller on your phone because this app sends your contacts to their server and voids the privacy.\n3) Always keep Notifications OFF for any app, this will help you save more ram and longer battery backup. You can do it in two ways: (i) Go to particular app>>settings turn all notification off. (ii) Go to Settings>>Apps, select app and UNcheck Show Notifications.\n4) Keep your WiFi and Data OFF when you don't need it.\n5) Do not install Facebook App and FB Messenger as they will eat more than 110mb of ram.\n\nWHY MOTO G (2ND GEN) AND WHY NOT ASUS ZENFONE 5 (16GB)\n1) OPERATING SYSTEM: Moto G Comes with Android 4.4.4 KitKat and is Upgradable to Android 5.0 Lollipop or later for 1.5 years. ASUS ZenFone 5 comes with Android 4.3 JellyBean and is Upgradable to 4.4.2. An update from ASUS confirms that Lollipop will arrive later in June 2015 but no guarantee.\n2) PROCESSOR: Moto G Runs on 1.2 GHZ SnapDragon ARM based Processor, On the other hand ASUS runs on 1.6 GHZ Intel x86 based processor. The point here is most of the (99%)android apps are designed to run on an ARM based cpu.\n3) RAM: Moto G has 1 GB of RAM and runs on simple stock android and contains no junkware. ASUS has 2GB of ram in which 800 MB is already used by the heavy UI and preinstalled apps that can not be disabled.\n4) UI: ASUS wins in the case of User Interface because its ZEN UI is very very beautiful and user friendly. Moto G has Simple stock UI.\n5) GPU: Moto is FAR Better in gaming than the Asus as its contains Aderno GPU.\n\nFLIPKART SERVICE\nPaid Extra 90 Rupees and Get phone after 2 day. POOR SERVICE.\n\nSo friends, if you find this review useful then spread this review so that all the users of Moto G can take advantage."

            "desc": "Update 30/4/2015:\n\nHave been using it for almost 3 months now.Some new things that I noticed:\n\n1)Stock Android lags -\nI was earlier of the perception that stock android doesn't lag or hang, but within a month I realized that it does.However, you can do a wipe cache partition(video available on youtube) to remove the lag and make it smooth and lag free.Also if you are using your phone from morning to night, at night; you will get lesser free ram available resulting in lag no matter how many processes you shut down.Just reboot in such cases.\n\n2)Windows is lag free only if you use the publicly released version-\nI recently updated my lumia 620 to windows 10 technical preview to try out the new features.(you can check out the features on youtube) It was on windows phone 8.1 version for the public before that.Even on a mere 512 mb ram it was racing around.But after updating to the technical preview the phone has slowed down tremendously.I am using 8.1 now again after using their software recovery tool and its smooth again\n\nHey guys,\nI have been using a lumia 620 earlier for 2 years(still working and using it as a backup)\nand I bought the moto g 2nd gen just for the stock android experience as many other better speced non stock alternatives were available at cheaper prices.\nI have been using it for the past 18 days.\nThe features of this device have been covered by many others.\nI will be citing the main differences between these two phones and their os.\n1)Camera-\nCamera on my lumia 620(5mp) has more detail.(helps in taking pictures of text filled documents)\nBut colors look more natural on the moto g 2nd gen.\n2)Working Individuals-\nFor office goers (People who have long lists of trailing mails) a lumia is better just because accounts are more organized.\n\nIn android, you have to open the mail to know : to whose mail has the sender responded to.(when two or more colleagues are involved.)\nIn lumia, when you open your inbox and click on the received mail,you see the entire list of trailing mails in the inbox window itself and you can click to see any of your unread mails.(I downloaded ms outlook for android but this feature is not available.)\n3)Battery life-\nAs far as the battery life is concerned;my lumia 620's 1300 mah battery lasts longer than my moto g 2nd gen's 2070 mah battery.\n\nOne of the unique benefits of a windows phone is the battery saver mode in which u can decide which apps can run in the background even while the battery saver mode is on.\n\nBattery life is a little better now on my moto g 2nd gen after I installed Du Battery Saver and switched off many app notifications but not even close to my lumia.\n4)App ecosystem-\nApp ecosystem as we all know is better on android, but windows isn't far behind.\nAll basic applications and popular games are available on windows.But apps are better optimized for android.\n5)Performance-\nAs far as day to day performance is concerned, you will not face any problems on either stock android or windows.\n6) Music -\nI'm an audiophile and a musician.I just cannot bear poor quality sound.\nAs far as the moto g 2nd gen speakers are concerned they are very clear and provide a stereo effect which helps hear all the details(songs downloaded from nokia mix radio).\nBut the headphone quality of my lumia 620 is unbeatable.It has dolby support which helps balance the sound output in the right manner.\nAlso mix radio(exclusive to lumias) helps you download unlimited original tracks for a limited period and after that u can download offline mixes.The quality of the songs downloaded is too good.\n7) SD Card Support - On windows apps can be INSTALLED on the SD Card unlike Android on which apps can only be transferred that too partly.\nFinal Verdict:\n1)If u already own an android/lumia phone and want to upgrade(old phone is working fine) buy a phone of a different operating system for the new experience and add on features.\n2)If u already own an android/lumia phone and want to upgrade(old phone not working fine)\na)Buy/Stick to android if app ecosystem matters a lot to you(You download literally every app from the store)\nb)Buy/Stick to windows if you are an office goer and battery back up matters a lot to you.\nPlease click on yes if my review was helpful.\nThanks."

            "desc": "Update 27-02-2015\nIt is really frustrating that my my Moto G's Camera flash has stopped working. I cant take pictures at low light. Earlier I had a problem with its speaker which I was able to get the replacement from Flipkart as it got detected within 30 Days of buying but now I cant get a replacement and have to keep visiting the service center. The biggest problem is again I have to reset my phone to factory settings all the data will be lost including the games progress. Lets hope everything gets OK.\n\nWriting this review after using all the three phone\nI had bought the zenfone 5 just after the launch but after one month of continuous use I realized that it had some fault in the hearing speaker. I checked with my friends zenfone and it was perfectly OK. Flipkart was courteous enough to refund the same.\nAfter that I bought moto g new edition.\nI am not writing the specs comparison which you can get easily at Flipkart and its deceiving sometimes as on paper they may claim heaven but what matters is real performance. I am writing this one for helping the confused buyers considering the user experience and the things which are not compared/ highlighted in online reviews but matters a lot.\nDesign and build:\nBoth have the good build quality but I liked the moto g as it feels comfortable to hold. moto g is very soft on hand and for the same screen size its dimensions are less and thus easy to operate. Zenfone has a bigger form factor and the design is edgy so while holding in one hand or while talking its edges hurt.\nXiomi Redmi 1s is old school basic design with solid feel but @160g weight its too heavy to carry around.\nDisplay:\nThough on paper both have the same specs but the colors are more stunning and vivid on zenfone 5 it feels like an amoled screen. Moto g looks a bit washed out.\nXiomi Redmi 1s on paper has the same HD screen but it has a yellowish tinge in the screen and black is not true black as in Moto G so colour contrast is not that impressive.\nProcessor:\nAll the three have equally powerful processor not much difference.\nMultitasking:\nThough moto g has the less ram but as it runs vanilla android its requirement is also less so again it's equal in both and I did not find any lag in both.\nUser experience:\nzenui wins here as it gives many enhancements over the stock android but after android l upgrade on moto g the situation will completely change. Xiomi Redmi 1s MIUI is like a copy of iOS with lots of improvements but I didnt like personally as it doesnt look modern.\nGaming:\nI played heavy games like Injustice: Gods among us, Asphalt:8 & Real Racing on both the phones.\nIn this aspect the Zenfone 5 is clear winner as you can play almost all the games in best graphics setting without lag but again be ready keep a charger beside phone as it will eat your battery at approx 10% per 15 min.\nIf someone is expecting a great gaming experience in Moto g is not for you the above games runs flawlessly on Moto G at medium graphics setting. At high graphics setting the games may close in between due to low RAM but again Battery performance is much better here its 10% per 30 min.\nPls dont expect Xiomi Redmi 1s for heavy games it will get so hot that you may not be able to hold it.\nCamera:\nCamera in both the devices are equally good but the default camera app on moto g is pathetic. I installed Google camera app and its great.\nBattery:\nThis is the biggest con for zenfone 5. I had to carry my charger all the time. The battery management of Intel processors is still novice. I was traveling on train with GPS on as I was traveling for the first time to this place and the battery ran down from 99% to 30% in just 4.5 hours and still 2 hours journey left. What's the use of such phone which doesn't help in such situations. moto g is satisfactory in this aspect if not great as Qualcomm professors are frugal.\nXiomi Redmi 1s is OK in its price range but not great think that it consumes more battery due to heating of the device even on smallest of applications.\nSound:\nThe sound in the Zenfone 5 is really very low and in this aspect the Moto G is way ahead. Moto G is a great media device. Xiomi Redmi 1s s OK in its price range.\nThe discission completely depends on buyer but for me the battery life is more important compared to any other features so I prefer moto g although a bit pricey.\nNote: Xiomi Redmi 1s has improved in the heating department after the latest update from company but it still gets heated up. it took 3 updates from the company with each apprx 30 mb, 300 mb & 512 mb respectively. So make sure you have a broad band to be able to install these updates."

Couldn't keep up with the tracker's speed :)\n\nStill exploring, will update more later.\n\nHere are the first impressions -\n\n1. Screen: Nice, crisp and vivid, but only 720p. With Snapdragon 400, I guess 720p makes more sense than 1080p. It is 5 inches in size but feels compact and usable in single hand.\n2. Performance: Android 4.4.4 comes pre-installed. Lag-free so far. Runs Riptide GP pretty well. Should run all games meant for Snapdragon 400. MS Office, Facebook and Google Drive all work fast and fine.\n3. Sound: The front dual speakers are awesome. Very nice sound. None of the other Motos (E/G/X) so far had this kind of fidelity.\n4. Camera: 8 MP main cam & 2 MP front. Very good snaps so far both indoors and outdoors. Got only 20 mins to experiment :)\n5. Call quality: 2 mics with noise cancellation and a loud speaker! Feels good.\n6. Micro SD Slot: This is the greatest inclusion. Moto G sorely missed that. Good option.\n7. What else do you want? :) C'mon guys what else do you expect from a phone at this price point? It won't cook your meals or solve your financial problems. Use it practically. It's a good deal. The Moto + Google combination is working out for the masses!\n\nWill get back after a week or so with extended usage report."

            "desc": "Hi Everyone,\nI am initiating this, to appraise you all of the difficulties, Worst Customer Service, demanding 80% phone cost for repairing and wrong suggestions, I got from PC Support Motorola Service center,Pune and Live Assistance of Motorola India.\nRecently I have purchased Motorola 2nd Gen mobile from from flipkart. It was working awesome but unfortunately few drops of the water goes inside the phone from the bottom area and it's switched off. So I visited to Motorola service center Pune to repair my mobile. [PC Support]\nHowever I have faced worst customer service from Motorola and following difficulties I have faced in the service center:\n1. They opened back panel of my phone and told me about liquid damage, I agree with them and said please repair my mobile. Then the lady who checked my phone said, \"You have to pay 80% mobile phone cost to repair the phone.\". It was totally hilarious and shocking for me because they asked me 80% of money of my phone without checking the problem.\n2. After I refused to pay them the lady said please repair your mobile from local mobile shop if they can. [This part was very disappointed to me because how can any authorized service center can tell any customer to go unauthorized local shop to repair your mobile. Is this Motorola company provide service after sell in India?]\n3. As my phone is new and I don't want to test or experiment on my phone from any local mobile repair shop, I told her, \"Could you please at least check my phone and provide me details which part in the phone is damage exactly?\" Then she asked me to pay 250 Rs to check my phone and said \"We will call you about problem in 4-5 days.\" I said OK and asked them about written detailed report of what you checked and which parts are exactly damaged then she again refused and said, \"Our technical guy will call you that's it.\" I was very frustrated and paid them 250 Rs to see what they can tell me about damage of my phone.\n\n4. After experiencing this worst service from Motorola service center, I tried to chat with Motorola online chat assistance. I told him what I have faced problem in the service center and asked him, Is it really true, Motorola asked to his customer to pay 80% phone cost to repair mobile phone? But he was not able to answer my questions correctly.\nSuch kind of unprofessional suggestion and demanding money 80% money without checking problem was not expected out of a authorized service center of Motorola.\nHow can people will pay Motorola 80% mobile cost to repair faulty phone?\nAlso, I contacted Flipkart about this problem, however Flipkart Customer care said, \"It's not our problem. Please contact Motorola Service center. We are not responsible after sale service.\"\nNow I don't know whats is going to happen with my mobile. So I request everyone, Flipkart and Motorola cheating with customers as they are not providing good service after sales. So please don't buy any Moto phone.\nBest regards,\nPramod"

No chance.\nA call to to the Motorola Call Center yielded a 7k Quote for complete display replacement.\n7k to replace the glass(as far as I am concerned) on a 13k phone?\n\nI have decided to throw the phone and get another one (Not Moto).\nWhy? coz im sure the glass will break the next time the phone drops and I cant afford to be shelling out 7k every other month\n\nThe kicker is that Motorola offers a free one-time screen replacement for all phones ordered directly from its website. In India, the phone is sold exclusively through flipkart which effectively rules out the screen replacement offer. Talk about step motherly treatment.\nSo here's me saying Hi and Goodbye to the only Moto product I will ever own."

I have received the item at 1PM on Sep 8 and shot out a mail to Flipkart customer support within an hour describing the defects/issues.\n\nThe summary of issues I faced:\n\n1) The volume button rocks. I can overlook that. However, the volume down button doesn't work properly. I have to press the volume down button repeatedly to bring up the volume bar\n2) 3G and Edge: Neither of the SIM slots on my mobile picks the 3G/Edge connection profile.

I like its vividness.. Seriously my Mi3 didn't had that colour punchiness that this moto g have.....Also the Asus zenfone screen is comparatively less vivid..My friend own it.. No problems with the screen\n\nPerformance:-\nCAMERA:- Never expected that quality from a 13k phone, my canvas 2 colors' 8mp camera was a lot better than this at 8k.. Zenfone 5 has better camera than this one.. The images appear blurry and lost focused.. The mi3 camera is very good.\nGAMING:- This is the place where it hits the sweet spot.. It is lil bit better in gaming than Zenfone 5 but no way it could beat Xiaomi Mi3.. You can play any high end game on medium graphics setting without a lag but on high graphics setting it will tend to miss a frame or two..\n\nSPEAKERS AND HEADSET:- These are loud but while listening on the highest level of sound , they seem to be cracking a little bit.. So they are better than the competition at this price but not the best... And dont even dare to compare them with HTC's stereo speakers.. HTC's speakers are way too superior to those..\nHeadset output is good but here also nothing beats my HTC Desire 820...\n(I own a sennheiser , skullcandy titan ,Skullcandy Ink'd 2, Mi ear phones and Creative ep 630 sony MDR-XB30 ..So I do have a little bit of knowledge and experience..)\n\nCALL CLARITY AND \"SAR\" VALUE:-\nThe call clarity is good but not excellent.. The best call clarity among the mobiles I used until now is from HTC Desire 820...\nWhen I bought the phone, the SAR values mentioned on flipkart website were 0.55 and 1.01 W/Kg at body and head and suddenly after 2-3 days they changed them and increased the values on their product page.. And I was UNABLE TO LOCATE THE SAR VALUE ON THE BOX AS WELL AS PRODUCT, WHILE ITS MANDATORY FOR THE MANUFACTURERS TO MENTION THE SAR VALUE ON PRODUCT ITSELF ACCORDING TO INDIAN REGULATIONS..\nI bought that phone for my dad as my dad have strong affection for Motorola...\n\nI feel that this is a downgrade to previous moto G in terms of the QUALITY. My 2-3 friends own gen 1 moto G and boy it feels way too superior to use than this cheap quality product.\nI have owned Mi3 and now I understood that really XIAOMI is the best in cheaper phones...Mi3 no way feels cheap like this phone.\nFIRST TIME BUYERS WILL FIND MOTO G 2nd gen TO BE ON PAR, but ones who have habit of changing mobiles like me, will find this phone to be costly in terms of what it offers power wise.. It should have been 11999 as compared to the competition.\nEnd result:\n\nFriends if you want a real smartphone experience then please take a look at YU Yureka or go for Zenfone 5 so that you will save 3-4k and also will get more value for money.. And lastly, if you have a strong affection for stock android, then go with Moto G2.\n\nUPDATED 20/02/2015:\n\nAfter the LOLLIPOP UPDATE, the battery seems to be lasting more, or should I say far more... The entire experience after the update is very very good... But as compared to Mi3, its still below par.. But as Mi3 sale is over and there is no competition except Zenfone 5, it seems moto g2 is the ultimate winner..Currently, I own a HTC Desire 820 and moto g2 is being used by my dad.. Now he is satisfied with the mobile after the update...\nOther than that, the phone is smooth as butter.. Lollipop ruined my nexus 7 but this moto g seems to be a very good handler for the lollipop update..\nSo overall, I will strongly recomment others to go with moto g2 ( after lollipop update only) if they are looking for proper balance of performance, design and software.. I am in love with lollipop... Waiting for it on my HTC desire...\nThank You for reading this.. Will update soon as per the experiences.."

The Stereo speakers, Camera and additional storage are the biggest upgrades over the previous phones.\n\nThe only con in this phone is the very average battery life. If one is a regular user of the phone for browsing, whatsapp, etc several times a day I feel the battery will drain out in about 8-10 hours.\n\nOverall very much satisfied with this phone for a price of Rs 12,999/- and one can buy on demand and not wait for your lucky chance every Tuesday."

My friend have ASUS Zen Phone 5 and i compared all aspects and my reaction is just amazing because in many aspects it beat the Asus like in Camera quality (front specially its front camera is exceptional even my friend's galaxy s5 can't beat it),build quality,look wise ,call quality ,gps, multitasking ,the display of the phone is far better than asus although both have 294 pixel but\ncolor contrast and brightness in my moto g is far better (he also amaze when we test it).and Last what i Love the most is its dual STEREO SPEAKERS which is at the front produce a clear sound . Its sound quality is exceptional . That's all .Frankly go for the moto g 2 for after sale services also and you got the Kitkat 4.4.4 in it and in Nvember when Android L will come in market you would be the first to get it .

Its about the end user experience after receiving a faulty device.\n\nI bought this phone on October\nI did face a lot of issues and got replaced three times and the replaced mobile had more issues than the first mobile.\n\n1st Mobile: WORKED PERFECTLY, no hardware or software issues except for battery, which drained in less than 3hrs. So requested a replacement.\n\n2nd Mobile: Camera issue, Flash issue, Touch stuttering issue, Network drop issue, 3G connectivity issue. Requested replacement.\n\n3rd Mobile: Combine all the above issues, I thought to live with that and suddenly one day the phone crashed while using camera and rebooted. Guess what? the phone got stuck in \"boot loop\"(Google It), I call it LIMBO.\n\n4th time: Got refunded. It took me a whole day explaining the \"Flipkart Tech Support\". Some how those people understood my distress call and refunded the money.(You guys know how support works right. pathetic!!!)\n\nHere is my findings and a word of caution to all fellow on-line shoppers\n\n*The phone is great for the price, if you are lucky to get a good one.(Some of my friends bought this phone during the initial sales and they never faced any issues)\n\n*Once replaced you wont get a new phone but a refurbished phone.(APPLIES TO ALL PRODUCTS IN FLIPKART)\n\n*I found that the product went out of stock a week back and it is back in stock now, PLEASE DON'T BUY IT, not all are new phones sold right now in the current lot, many are refurbished model.(Verified from a trusted source)\n\nI am a Sony fanboy, I just wanted to experience the stock android interface. Since Moto G2 offered a good specification at lower price with near stock android I bought this phone. The phone is amazing if you get a good one. From my experience I am never going to buy a cheap phone ever ever ever in my life.\n\nHeading to Sony Smartphone Lounge......"

Also, you will need it to send mp3 and other files. Also, you can set your own ringtone by moving files to ringtone folder using fx.\n+Join fb group named Motorola Moto G (2nd Gen) for more queries.\n\nReview:\n+ Heats very rarely in normal use\n+ Nice build quality\n+ Pure Android (4.4.4) with google now launcher, no lag observed till now.

Flipkart takes all credit here.\n\nNote: I have used this phone for only 24 hours.\nAbout Phone:\nThis Phone comes with 5 inch IPS display with Gorilla glass on top of that. Screen resolutions is perfect and you will feel good when you see it. It is almost like Moto g but bigger screen so that makes even more cool.\nI have been using this Phone without removing the screen cover motorola provide. (I will remove it soon and write about touch sensitivity in my next post).\n\nDual Front speakers are extra ordinary and with audio settings, it is as perfect as it gets. Loud, Clear sound you can hear.\n\nProcessor is same as Moto G, so if you have used moto g before then u can skip to next point. Processor is smooth and dint lag a bit till now. I have used browser to test and doing other tasks like running other apps. all is working smooth.\n\nAbout camera, i had a very bad experience in the beginning. I taken some pictures without flash it was working fine and i turned on flash from auto, camera was not responding. i had to re boot the phone again. After sometime, i tried taking pics with flash on and it worked (IDK how). I have reported this motorola india. Hopefully they will come up with some update.\n\nI have made a few phone calls, noise cancelling is excellent. You can hear other person's voice crystal clear. This is excellent for all.\n\nIt has Micro SD card so that is advantage with google gives you option of back ups, so you never run out of memory i feel.\n\nAbout battery i have got decent battery juice without charging much. Again advance part of battery in Next post.\n\nthat's all folks for now. Next post will definitely contains all Pros and Cons of the phone.\n\nOverall experience i fell is if this phone gets an update then it is a perfect buy with good price."

I bought a white one and it looks stunning and the phone has good finish.I have used my friends old Moto G which was much better than my samsung Y duos and the new Moto G feels amazing with its upgrades.\nBut the 2nd gen Moto G isn't that good when we compare the screen resolution and picture clarity, with the old one. .\nAnother major concern is the battery. Moto G with the screen size of 4.5 inch had 2070 mah, which was the one of the drawbacks of the phone. Atleast now they should have used 2500 mah battery for the 5inch new moto G, but they have used the same 2070 mah battery. So I should spend another 1000-1500Rs on a power bank.\nThe company should have focused on the internal specs, but the budget remains the same as in the old moto G-Rs12999. So this has overshadowed all the minor cons.\n\nAsus zenfone 5, Xiaomi Mi3...... may look better than Moto G with its advanced specs but the chinese mobiles wont last long. Also I dont want to buy a chinese product and boost their economy and most importantly, I read in an article that the Xiaomi mobiles aren't secured.\nSo in the end Moto G is the best pick in the under 15K category even with its limited specs."

Sometimes I'm unable to drag the notification bar down or sometimes Chrome won't register any clicks but is able to scroll pages up and down. Tapping on the URL box won't open it up. Reboot seems the only solution to these issues.\n\nI've asked for a replacement piece. Lets see how the new phone performs.\n\nUpdate (12th September): After calling up flipkart every day for the last 3-4 days and listening to their standard response (we'll give you a callback within 24hrs or the end of the day), I finally got a call from their customer support team, asking me to remove the screen protector and also do a hard reset of the phone by holding the volume down and power key while the phone was powered down. That did get me to the bootloader screen, but I had to read other tutorials on the internet to wipe the data and cache partition from the recovery screen. After the phone enters the Recovery screen, you would need to hold the Volume up key for 10-15 seconds and then tap and release the power key. That'll bring up the wipe menu.\n\nAnyways, I did all that, and the phone worked perfectly for about half an hour, until I went to the PlayStore App to download Whatsapp, and I couldn't click on the 'Install' button. Tapping it would instead bring up the screenshots beneath the button. Then I tested pulling the notification bar down and lo and behold, it didn't work and was stuck. Tried locking the screen and unlocking, but that didn't solve the issue. It was still stuck and also I couldn't tap on the URL box on Chrome, so clearly it wasn't registering my taps like the way it should.\n\nThen called up Flipkart CC, recounted my woes again for almost the 6th time, and they finally agreed for a replacement, which is suppose to reach me by 9PM tomorrow. Had they been active and had themselves given me a call and offered a replacement, I wouldn't have had to call them multiple times.\n\nNow I can't figure out who I'm more disappointed with - Flipkart (for their crappy customer service) or Motorola (for their crappy phone).\n\nI'll wait for the replacement and see if that performs without any flaws. Not much hope left, as mostly all 1star reviews here are about touch issues. Will update my review accordingly."

If I use it only for wi-fi then it takes 2.5 hrs to drain battery. Another problem is the charger...it takes 3.5-4 hrs to charge the battery. once the battery is at 30-25% then need to charge it other wise it takes very long time to charge. I don't expect this from a Moto (google) phone. Hope everyone is facing the same issue.\nOther than the battery issue overall phone is nice."

After 2 weeks of usage, I am seeing hairline scratches.Better to have screen guard or flip cover.\n\n2. Average battery life. That's usual with android OS which has mediocre power management. On Normal usage ( 1 hr phone call, 45 mins songs, facebook, mail check) back up provided is 36 hrs. Have seen people complaining about battery backup. one sugggestion is to try apps like \"Battery doctor\" to optimize battery usage. There are lot of unwanted process which will be running that drains battery so fast.\n\n3. Charger provided is below standard.. its heating up itself and the phone while charging, so I stopped using that. When it comes to ear-bud, it's not worth talking about.\n\n4. Sometimes, camera flash light stays on even after closing camera app (am talking about graceful exit). Have noticed this issue only once. Then ,restarted the phone, flash light stayed for few seconds after reboot, then turned off.\n\n5.Screen picks up finger impression and dust.. its horrible..\n\n6.While listening music, if u receive a call, after attending and hanging up the call, the songs resume with low volume. when u check volume status , volume bar shows full !!!!. expected behaviour is to resume the songs with previous known volum lelvel. Moving to next track resumes to last known volume %.... ugly software.\n\nBut there are lot of +ve about this phone which other reviewers pointed out.\n\nSomehow, I feel this phone is very delicate..

Samsung almost gone black in daylight.\n\nRegarding the screensize, the full screen view is available only on youtube video and Kindle book reading mode, as far I get to check. So the extra screen size is not usable in normal usage. As Samsung has hardware buttons which are extra to screen, so the actual display area is same as in 4.7 inch screen on Samsung or other hardware button android devices.\n\nThe camera is great. The front and back camera is giving satisfactory pictures in low light also. Battery is average, you will need to charge once a day at normal usage.\n\nMemory it has almost 12GB for user storage.

I received the product on 29/05/2015.\nAfter receiving the product, when i started using the handset, i immediately started noticing issues with the handset. After only few hours of usage i realized the following problems -:\n\n1. I could not hear the receiver's/caller's voice whenever I made/received a phone call.\n\n2. Then suddenly the display went off. After that, every time i locked the screen, display would go completely off.\n\n3. When I tried restarting the phone it would get extreme hot.\n\nI put a request for return(return id 20964090) with flipkart. But dealing with the Customer Support has only been a hassle.\n\nI received an email saying your technical expert would contact me at a certain specified time. However I did not receive any form of communication from flipkart. It was only after i wrote an email to customer support that i got a reply saying that again your technical support would contact me at a specified time. However, i still didn't receive any call from your team.\n\nAfter this, I called Flipkart's Customer Service department and the service employee was anything but patient with me. He was rude and had no interest in listening to my complaint. He said me that I would receive a call from your technical expert within 24 hours.\n\nHowever, within a few hours I received an email saying that the seller has disapproved my return request.\n\nHow can the seller disapprove my return request without any explanation ? Your technical expert never contacted me, so how did the seller know what's wrong with my device. Do they just cancel a return request without even analyzing or looking at the device ?\n\nAfter all this, I have to say that my experience with Flipkart has only been abysmal. When you claim to be such a well established and respected e-commerce business, its about time you start acting like one.\nCongratulations !!! , you've managed to disappoint a loyal customer and lost him forever.\n\nAgain, I request you take a look at this and take necessary steps to handle customer grievances more efficiently. Let me be very clear that I would not hesitate to take this matter to the concerned authorities, if need be."

Their automated process will send one time schedule to call for the troubleshooting. In case accidentally if you miss that call again you have to wait 24 hours. But, in case they didn't call they will again schedule another callback after 24hours. The call time will never be your choice and they will try to drag the days(every 24hours) so that the ticket will expire. The ticket will be resolved without your knowledge and they will ask you to raise new ticket so that again the process will start from scratch.\nBy writing emails to customer care they will never worry or care. In spite of follows up one fine day we gave up and accepted to live with that faulty mobile.\nAt the end, Flipkart motive is achieved.\nIf you get a phone with no issues, they really you are lucky.

There are quite a lot of myths about the device and I might be able to help the confused lot..!\n\n1. First of all..Many people think that this phone has the same back cover problem which was there in the Moto E, because the design process is the same on the two. Well, that is not the case. The back cover fits perfectly..so no issues with that.. :)\n\n2. People also do think that the BATTERY backup is not as good as the original Moto G. Well, yes up to some extent it IS true, considering the 5 inch display and the same size battery but its not horrific..It still lasts for about a day with mixed usage (like casual gaming, music for an hour or 2 and some surfing). Note that if you are a really heavy user..it would last up to 4.5-5 hours (with Wi-fi, mobile data of course and movies, heavy gaming etc)\n\n3. The STEREO SPEAKERS...yes those are true stereo speakers! We do have a Left channel and a Right channel, but they are by no means GREAT speakers...there is a bit of distortion, specially at loud volumes. Its good for gaming, Youtube videos, movies etc..but when it comes to pure music...the Pro's would not be that happy with it..Although, for average users like me, it is a nice experience.\n\n4. GAMERS..!! This point is for you.. Well, this device certainly can play almost any game in the Playstore without any issues.. BUT it would be nice if you set game graphics to medium. Like for example Asphalt 8..it runs much better when you set the game on Medium settings of graphics. No issues otherwise..\n\n5. CAMERA...Well , yes I mentioned earlier that I am not going to talk about specs..but I cant help.. The front camera (2 megapixel) is exceptionally good..believe me..It does a lot better than front cameras of other phones..and surprisingly the rear camera too performs better than expected. Moreover, in low lighting it does even better than Moto X..yes that;s true..Picture colours, saturation and low lighting images better than Moto X..!\n\nAll other factors like Call quality, Signal strengths, connectivity, everything is upto the mark..No need to mention that.\nWell, all things considered..the performance of this phone is exceptional for this price bracket. This phone is for everyone..Gamers, music lovers(not the pro's), office workers..whoever you are..it piece of beauty is all you need..!! Cheers..! :)"

Seriously are these guys wantedly extending the delivery time because i didn't opt for next day delivery?.\nBuild Quality :\nThis phone has a great build quality. Even though its back cover is removable you can mistake it for an unibody design. It feels very good to hold the phone and the smooth rubbery back is awesome. Its does not provide a great grip at the same time its not slippery.\nDisplay :\nIts really a big phone. This is the 1st time am using a 720p phone and for my eyes the display looks crisp and clear. I don't speak about viewing angles and all. Duh there is only one view in which you are going to use your phone :P. Outdoor visibility will definitely take a blow. There is no pixellation and all. Reaching the top of the screen is fairly easy thanks to the dimple on the back and the back cover material. Apply android L wallpaper on your phone and you are going to see a nexus 5 in your hand :).\nSpeakers :\nNothing much to say here. These are just speakers which are in front and thats all. You can be free of worries that you are not going to miss any calls even if the phone lies over a pillow or a bed. Ringtone, alarm and audio in games are fairly loud. But while playing music it is not that impressive. I tried with different music players but the volume is less only. But i don't use speakers to hear songs as i have a good pair of ear phones. Audio quality from ear phones is flawless.\nBattery life :\nFrom the time jelly bean came out battery life in android is a huge miss only and that continues still now. I read somewhere that a good smartphone should last for about 12 hours and if that is the case then this is a good smartphone. Don't expect anything more. And yeah just like others say it takes more time to charge the phone. From 20% it took a solid 2 hours to reach 80%.\nPerformance :\nMark this up. Even after 2 years you will get the same silky smooth performance in this phone. Every thing is buttery smooth and lag free. You can check gaming reviews in youtube to get some idea.\nCamera :\nGenerally i don't use the camera that much so it won't to be fair for me to speak about the camera. Good to know my phone has an 8MP shooter :D.\nThings that impressed me :\n1. Build quality\n2. Stock android experience\n3. Call clarity(quality)\n4. The price i paid for this experience\nThings that made me worry :\nApart from that network issue nothing else is there for me. Am happy with my phone.\nUpdates(After 3 days of usage) :\nThe network drop issue what i had mentioned earlier is solely my bad. The guy who had cut my sim did not insert it properly. It is a click to insert and remove mechanism. After inserting the sim fully till i got the click i did not face any issue with calls.\n\nOutdoor visibility is fair. If you get any calls or receive a text you will be able to clearly see and read the content. You can even reply without any issues. But reading a full length article is a big no no.\n\nI had mentioned that volume from the speakers while playing songs was low. I tried 3 players Rocket, Poweramp and Google Play Music. Out of these 3 poweramp gives the same loud experience you get during calls or when your alarm is ringing. You can enjoy the speaker quality with poweramp. Try to use fusion player also and check."

The dual front speakers are not very loud but get's the job done very well.\n3. Micro SD is a nice add on atleast in the Indian market.\n4. The latest and the greatest android, also the promise to get the fastest update.\n5. Price : A thousand buck less than its predecessor , Motorola nailed it.\n6. Availability : Unlike some of the other affordable offerings Motorola has been great in availability. A device is great when you can actually buy it.\n7. Build Quality is in similar lines with the previous generation, which by every means is great.\n\nCons :\n\n1. WIFI Issues : The fact that wifi is latest here, is great but there is a catch. It happens it does not support some access points/router authentication types which generally other devices does. This was why I replaced it in the first place. But in the replacement device the problems were same, then I did some digging, the fact it is 802.11 b/g/n/ac compatible but the authentication type it is compatible is very limited, i.e. WEP(bit encryption m not sure), WPA/WPA2 (this worked for me). and 802.1X Radius. That's it. If your router has some other it will not detect it even.\n\n2. Size : This may not be a problem for some but yes this thing has grown up huge since its predecessor.\n\n3. Battery : 2070 mah used to power 4.5, same is used to power 5.0 , the math is simple here, with not a good outcome.\n\n4. Buttons : This time buttons have a soft touch feel to it. I am not sure about how it feels but the response of the click is certainly not tactile as it had previously.\n\nOverall, Cons other than wifi issues should not have been here considering what we get and what we pay.\n\nRecommended : 8/10"

Next day I see this ad in newspaper about Moto G second generation with bigger 5 inch screen and six vouchers , on launch day with rs 3000 off on laptops and lucky first 100 buyers of moto g to get 100 percent cash back. I pressed the buy button.\nMoto G arrives next day sharp by 3.00 afternoon from WS retail-a flipkart company (safe to buy from they as they offer 30 day replacement on gadets as against 10 day of other vendors on flipkart and 7 days on snapdeal).\nThe Phone in white with 5 inch screen looked beautiful , even though was packed very simple with no accessory except charger.\nI did not use phone initially for three days as also have s4 and had another sim which was big and could not fit in moto g.\nAny how got two sims put in moto g and am using moto g for 3 days now here are observations.\nPROS :\n1.Budget 5 inch hd phone under rs 13000 with good looking white colour compared average s4 samsung black looks\n2.Motorola has increased the screen size,and little on battery from 1900 t 2070 mah\n3.The phone with 1 gb does not hangs , so far , my s4 with 2gb does hangs and quite smooth to use in that budget compared to other phones in expensive category.\n4.DUAL Sim is a big advantage for business class people or who want to use two sims but carry one phone. I do not find many quad core decent brand phones with same dual sim featue in this budget.\n5. This moto g set now has expandable memory slot to 32 gb, welcome step.\n6.The latest version of android 4.4 on phone will get upgraded to next version immediately.\n\nNow the CONS :\n1. Motorola has not increased the battery strenth. A meagre 2070 mah is not sufficient to run phone entire day , if you plan to use dual sim, internet on phone, couple of prints from phone directly,whats app, The battery sadly lasts half a day only even when I have not listened to any music or clicked any picture. any 5 inch phone should have at least 2600 mah battery or no point in buying a phone unless you are okay to charge your phone twice a day. It is here where motorola looses out big time for not giving comparable battery for a 5 inch phone.\n2. The processor remains the same as on old moto g but though that does not reduces speed to a great length , but avid gamers (I am not a gamer at all) will like faster processors here.\n3. The call reception is okay. But sound quality from receiver is not as great as on a samsung set.It is at acceptable or satisfactory level but not great as on my s4.\n\nOverall a great buy for dual sim functionality , great looks and functionality at budget but big let down on battery. Hence my three stars"

I thought God finally answered my prayers by intoducing a budget smart phone with all the excellent features i wanted, which no other phone could beat. But then came the dampener, when i looked at the storage feature: Moto g had only 12.9 GB of storage, which will never be enough for my huge music collection. So i was really dissappointed.\n\nLast Friday, when the moto g 2nd gen was launched, i was extremely happy! Finally i got my moto g with a memory card slot!

Some of the Pros and Cons that I found are listed below.\n\nPros:\n- Big 5\" screen.\n- Quad core procesor\n- micro sd card support.\n- 12.9 GB of internal memory, would be more than enough for all the apps.\n- 8 MP rear and 2 MP front camera.\n- Latest Android and guaranteed upgrade to L\n- Light, handy, rugged and beautiful look, it will be everybody's eye candy!\n- Gorilla Glass protects the phone from scratches.\n- flash support and secondary camera\n- 3G support on both sims\n\nCons:\n- micro sim (It was difficult to get a micro sim, so I had to take the risk and cut the mini sim in a local mobile store.\n- Non-removable battery\n- 1 GB RAM ( moto could have increased it to atleast 1.5 GB) but it does't affect the performance.\n- Battery backup not so impressive. It gives average battery life. But The Android L OS is expected to increase the battery backup, so keep your fingers crossed!\n- FM radio not playable through the speakers:\n\nI have seen many users complaing that the FM radio cannot be payed on the loud speakers.\n\nHere's a solution to play FM radio via speakers:\nDownload the app HF button from the Play store and voila! your problem's solved!\n\nCheers!\n\n- Raghav"

It looks Moto Market Strategy worked, as it provides high end enhanced features with mid range costs,making mid end & lower end customers to enjoy the high end stuff.\n\nLets go through Pros & Cons.\n\nPros:\n1) Increasing in size of screen, but still the make the design as portable within single hand.\n2)Front end speakers, i am here to assure that double speakers at front end will provides a A-class audio clarity, that not even we seen in high end mobiles.\n3) Rear Camera is of 8 MP and provides descent snaps(Even blurred image is occupying 1.5MB,shows the quality) and front cam is 2MP,which is also worth while.\n4) provided with SD card option--Expandable upto 32GB.\n5)Performance wise no issue, i had few graphic based games installed and tried to play simultaneously, i didn't find any lags & hangs.\n6) Smooth touch & nice display intensity.\n7) Few enhanced features in KitKat 4.4.4 itself(find difference in setting wallpaper by on screen and widgets are entirely separated from apps inside menu etc..) And all these enhanced features are taken from Android-L for impatience users.\n8) Ensured with Android-L update.\n9) Nice battery standby.\n\ncons:\nHere, it is pretty hard to find cons, since manufacturer is providing best as per \"features vs price\" graph.\n1) Pixel density is slightly reduced in 2nd generation, but it is hardly observed to naked eye. (first generation users can identify it as they are accustomed to high pixel density). For new Moto customers its like a feast since other mobiles are not even providing 294ppi display(Samsung Grand/Grand 2 runs on 224ppi & HTCexplorer series on 252ppi) .\n2) Larger Icons on display i.e no option to change the icon size.(few websites are saying that it is a stack Android-L feature,but not sure).\n3) Battery will drain a bit quicker on 3G network.\n\nVerdict: High End features to Mid range customers. No lags & hangs moreover Android-L upgrade. Nice camera & descent display. That all a common customer expects and Moto delivered it successfully. Motorola+Google combo is going to rock Indian market again via flipkart."

Got one faulty product and asked for replacement. After 2 times rejection , they finally agreed to replace my phone ! I woow !! flipkart is so wonderful ! ! This is not the end..\nIn return the product that I got was 'smart phone ke naam pe dabba' ! It was constantly giving me 6-8 hrs backup ! Raised return request again ! ! Now again faced disappointment from India's no 1 seller ! They checked my phone with 'Smart Check' app (I guess it is created by Rajnikant !! ) and told me my phone is ok and they dont see any issue in it.. in 15 minutes call duration I lost 12 % battery charge ! and they said my phone is fine ! Request rejected ! ! and they suggested me to go to authorize service center to check it up !\nNear by to my place I got one. When I reached at Moto authorize service center , they simply said this phone is supposed to give 2-3 hours battery back up when connected to internet !!\nAgain raised request for replacement , probably my 5th replacement request with 20 days of buying my 'new' phone !!\nThis time customer center guys came up with another wonderful test that is supposed to be done by authorize service center guys ! I opposed , and said my phone is in under replacement warranty then why should I go and do this kind of experiment ! wanted to escalate this matter to higher management , so the call center guy said in 4 hours I will be getting a call back.. that date was 25th or 26th of March, today is 15th May ! ! I am still waiting 4 hours to complete !\n\nDear Flipkart,\nI don't know you guys will read this or not, but just want to share my concerns with you. You have walked down a long distance to get this position , don't just let it go. You don't have to return my phone. I don't need that anymore .It is a basic courtesy to respond to your customer. Why to keep the request open , give a proper justification and closed that. Definitely I will never buy anymore product from your 'online mega store' !\nThanks for this wonderful disappointing service that I never expected ! !\n\nFinally after I got the call frm FK,,, again same technical gyan n all... suggested me to go back to service center !! I had enuf of torture !! no more.. I politely requested them to cancel this return request , I will live up with my 7-8 hrs backup wala phone.. cant take this kind of discussion anymore ! !\n\nGood bye Flipkart..."

While there are a few pros as I am a first time smartphone buyer, there are more than a few cons, though I have listed only a few.\n\nPros:\n1. Excellent Display\n2. Good camera - both front and back\n\nCons:\n1. Very poor Battery life, even for my limited net usage and video-streaming etc.\n2. Very slow processor. This is really painful as even to load contacts or phone mode, it takes ages. It's really, really very slow. I have not downloaded many apps at all but still because of its 1GB RAM, phone is very slow as more than 1/3 is always engaged with system apps (read Google preloaded apps) and another 1/3 with the downloaded apps, even when they are not running. Net result is I have to download Battery Booster and Power booster and keep running them every 1 hour or so.\n3. An extension of the previous point - Lot of Google apps are preloaded and keep running in the background and there seems to be no way to shut them down without uninstalling them. and you don't know what would happen to the phone if you uninstall them.\n4. Not very user friendly. For eg, you can't change to Silent mode at the touch of a button like in Nokia. Need to get into settings, audio, etc. and then change to Silent or Vibrate etc.\n5. For a first time smart phone user, the size is quite big. It becomes difficult to hold the phone and talk for more than 5-10 minutes as it starts paining after sometime.\n6. Takes a long time to recharge - more than 3 hours to recharge fully"

The power button is half pressed so u dont have to press harder and works only 50% of the time. Very good for thumb muscles.\n\n2: The battery life is awesome. My best performance was 6 hours. It was jaw dropping. Plus the battery gets headed when charged. Awesome for those cold and chilly nights.\n\n3: The resolution is crisp like a wet 'papad'. A little twist and i can literally count the pixels. Forget abt using the phone at a slant angle.\n\n4: 10 mins of playing the Game and Its hot enough for a f**king omlet. Saves Gas i guess...\n\nPlus when asked for a replacement, i was asked to install a app and was asked to replicate every problem during that call. How am i gonna show my pixelated screen and non functional button to a person on call?? Lastly i gave up and politely asked her to cancel the request. I guess time to move on to Amazon or Snapdeal.

            "desc": "I was really excited to buy this phone. I ordered one from Flipkart and I got it within three days to my place Kollam via courier. So I give 5 start for delivery and packaging.\n\nNow, I'll say what I felt when using this phone, because your experience might be different from this. Motorola says this is an exceptional phone at exceptional price. Let's find out if that is true. But before that, keep all your expectations below Rs. 13,000/-\n\nPros:\n\n1. 5 inch HD (1280 x 720) IPS LCD display with Corning Gorilla glass 3\n\nThe display has a ppi of 294 like all 5 inch HD displays do. So you won't notice any pixelation. The Gorilla glass protects the display from scratches caused by normal use. The IPS LCD gives a very good viewing angle. The ambient light sensor detects and adjusts the screen brightness so that it won\u2019t be a problem to use the phone in high lit or low lit conditions.\n\n2. Quality build\n\nI don't think Motorola will take any chance to reduce the build quality of their phones to cut down the price and compete with others. So this phone like every other Moto phones is solid and sturdy. You can feel it by just holding it. The phone fits perfect on your hands due to its curvy design of the back.\n\n3. Great 8MP primary camera for stills and 2MP secondary camera.\n\nThe 8 MP camera let's you to capture any moment with the fine details, be it a well lit or low lit situation. The camera performs very well in low lit conditions. The color gamut is very good too (but a little warm). The HDR is ok. The focus point exposure adjustment is good though it has its limits. Overall the camera is great for stills. The secondary 2 MP camera can satisfy your selfie needs.\n\n4. Front facing stereo speakers.\n\nSound quality of the stereo speakers is good and they are loud enough to enjoy music, games and movies, but don't expect too much.\n\n5. Latest Lollipop flavor.\n\nIt's Android and nothing is more pleasing than enjoying the latest flavor of it. I got the phone updated with latest Lollipop out of the box. So I didn't have to update it myself, and the software updater says the phone is up to date.\n\n6. Water resistant coating (not waterproof)\n\nMotorola says the Moto G2 got water resistant nano-coating to protect the phone from moisture inside out. But that doesn't mean it is waterproof. Water could still enter it. So it's just an additional protection and be careful with your phone near water.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Battery really could have been improved\n\nThe 2070 mAh is not enough for a 5 inch phone. I still wonder why they didn't increase the battery capacity when they upgraded the previous Moto G. Even the new Moto E 2 has got 2390 mAh capacity. The battery is built-in and non-removable. That's not a problem at all.\n\n2. Needs more RAM\n\nYou'll get around 500 MB of free RAM after the initial boot without installed any user applications. But things start to change when you start multi-tasking and switch between different apps. It'll get really annoying. Some of the competitors of Moto G2 have more than 1 GB of RAM, for example Samsung Galaxy S3 Neo - 1.5GB, Asus Zenfone 5 - 2GB etc.\n\n3. No Full HD Video Recording\n\nWhy the hell is that ? That's all I want to ask. But you can still play Full HD videos and movies.\n\n4. Very bad headphone output\n\nI have to say this; the 3.5mm jack output really sucks ! You'll need a very sensitive pair of headphones to enjoy any music. That's a shame.\n\n5. No USB Data Cable\n\nA charger with removable USB cable would have been handy.\n\nOther pros and cons:\n\n1. The power and volume rocker buttons have some play and are hard to press\n2. OTG support\n3. No file manager application\n\nOther competitors in the price range:\n\nSamsung Galaxy S3 Neo, HTC Desire 616 Dual Sim, Asus Zenfone 5, Sony Xperia M2\n\nBottom line : I'd really recommend this phone to others. :)"

But i face some problem which i tell both Motorola care & flipkart care but no body can solve this issue. Now m going 2 share some thing abt this phone.\nIf u have 3G net pack then nobody want to get 2g speed and network\nSo many customer facing the main problem of 3G/WCDMA network in Moto G (2nd Gen) always in dual mode . In india as we know that signal strength in 3G network is not good so in Dual mode Moto phones due to their internal phone setting always prefered 2 g network even if select in 3g network in your phone setting.I told this issue to motorola customer toll free care and flipkart care but no body solve this issue. They told me in this series of moto phone in 3g always in dual mode.\nNow i have to solve this issue my self and any moto customer can do this procedure as in below\n\nNow,\nOpen your Phone (Dialler) app{the one which you open while dialling a number}.\nEnter this code: *#*#4636#*#*\nAn app known as \"Testing\" will be launched.\nTouch the first option \"Phone information\".Don't touch other options.\nYou will notice a drop-down option above \"turn off Radio\" button. Tap on it.\nSelect the third option \"WCDMA Only\". Wait for a while...\nYou will see that network has changed to 3G mode in the notification bar. If network doesn't change, touch the \"turn off Radio\" button. you will see your phone's signal are lost. Now again turn it on by tapping on the same button.\nYour 3G/HSPA/UMTS must have been enabled now.\n\nCAUTION: Inside the 'Testing' app, don't touch the other settings unless you are sure about them or you will land up in trouble & PHONE MAY DAMAGE.\n\nTIP: If you think remembering or dialling the code is difficult, then you can download the \"Phone Testing\" app from Play Store. It directly opens the \"testing\" options in 1 tap.\nBut i think Motorola now lenvo should slove this problem.Other Android smart phone maker like Samsung, Micromax have 3 option in their phone setting like u can select Dual mode (2g/3g) or only 2G OR Only 3G/Wcdma.I think Motorola should learn from other manufacturer phone maker and other thing listed in below.\n\n\nSound quality is very bad means feel very cracking sound when u are talking to someone no clear voice. irritate to me.\n\nSignal catching strength during travelling specially when u inter in roaming is LOST.Again U have to search network by manually.\n\nCongratulate for very good build and design. No problem in carrying ur phone.\nDisplay is good & you can update your phone software both in 3G and Wi-fi (WHEN LOLIPOP UPADTE IS AVAILABLE)\n\nBattery take so much time to charge and drain early if continuously connect in Wi-fi not suited for high end gaming it may be 2500 Mah but in this price range it's ok.\nLED light always glow in white not Colorful even if u select other Colour from settting. Moto should pay attention becoz of other phone maker even Micromax giving colorful Notification light\n\nBattery and Phone Signal Notification is not colorful and don't show percentage charge battery, u have to download apps from paly store for percentage.\nU can not record audio songs when u are listening Fm. Very disturb ur mood\nI think Motorola now Lenvo should come forward and solve this issue."

            "desc": "The successor to the 2013 stunner is more of a incremental update, nothing more than that. The fact that I call it incremental is because they have increased the screen size (which decreases the pixel density) , upgraded the cameras from 5 and 1.3 to 8 and 2mp respectively, added the sd card slot and yes of course it ships with Kitkat 4.4.4. The fact that motorola could have used an upgraded processor Snapdragon 410 instead of 400 and bumped up the ram to 2gb which is possible ( see Asus Zenfone 5 for example) and still havent used it takes one star away from it.\nNow as per my review I have used this device for a week now and have probably tested every aspect of it. As usual we'll have pros and cons as it has been ritualised in flipkart reviews :P\nPROS\n1. Screen, the 720p screen streched over 5 inches, never lets you feel that the pixel density has suffered, in my view though it is an IPS display with Corning gorilla glass 3 on it but it looks and feels just like an AMOLED. Colours are bright and display fares well when viewed in direct sunlight.\n2. Software, Kitkat 4.4.4 out of the box provides an experiences just like stock android and actually it is stock android with google now launcher and a few of motorola's apps which are usable especailly the migrate app which helps you in transferring your data from your older phone, and yes since it's stock android you'll get the lollipop 5.0 update weeks after nexus devices get it.\n3. Call quality, Motorola made the first mobile phone in the world , so it would not be an overstatement to say that call quality is amazing and havent dropped a single call or had problem in sound clarity over the last week or so, both the speakers work well while calling.\n4. Design, some may argue with this but the design is also one of its pros and the overall feel doesnt make you feel that it is a sub 15k phone, well done motorola with the curved design.\n5. SD card support, since you get only 12 gb internal storage adding a SD card support has certainly helped moto g overcome a big drawback from last year, it allows you to expand upto 32 gb alongwith which is decent.\n6. Performance, overall a strong contender for your daily driver as it offers fluid and smooth performance to breeze through all your social needs and youtube as well as some serious games.\nCONS\n1. Battery, even with moderate to low usage this phone struggles to keep pace and avg battery time would be around 8 hrs with low usage and 5-6 with moderate usage with screen brightness set at auto.\n2. Inconsistent Front Firing speakers, you expect the speakers to be loud, but at times they are too loud and the other its like someone whispering something in your ears.\n3. Headset, The one provided within the box are of cheap quality, and it will definitely hurt your ears if you use it to watch a movie or so.\n4. It takes time to charge the battery up even though its just 2070 mah\n5. Ram, 1 GB in my view isnt enough when Asus can accomodate 2GB ram in the similar price tag then moto should have atleast bumped up the ram. Since I tested almost every app and game you can to determine phone's strength while testing fifa 14, nfs most wanted , gta san andreas the absence of sufficient amount of ram was felt. But for daily usage without heavy duty tasks this phone is smooth as butter though lags due to heavy duty apps.\n6. Camera, though the primary camera shoots slomo videos at 720p(without audio) the cameras just make you feel you are holding a budget phone. Lack of 1080p video recording even though the chipset supports it, inconsistent photos sometimes over saturated and sometimes under saturated, even the HDR mode provides lacklusture photos as compared to my SE Xperia Pro (2011 made) the camera just gives up.\nVERDICT\nThe phone looks and feels like a premium phone and is pocket friendly and gives you the performance you expect from a phone in this price tag, lags a bit when installed lots of apps but will surely sail you through all your daily requirements. In the end YES it's a bang for buck device. GO FOR IT!"

When it comes to the device itself, let me tell you it currently is the undisputed king of the mid range tier of smartphones. I dont think any other OEM has a device on the market that offers a phone with a snapdragon 400, 1 gig of RAM and a promise of timely updated for less than 15K. Im excluding the likes of phones with those stupid mediatek crap and the ones with intel (asus zenfone) as im still skeptical about those phones when it comes to the performance, developer support and so on. I also exclude xiaomi because xiaomi phones are still hard to get and you have to rely on third party sites like ebay, olx etc to buy one and there are chances of many being fake. Beware! Ill put down some pros and cons.\nPlease read them (you can thank me later) ;).\n\nPros:\n\nBuild: The phone has a very good build quality. Has an easily removable back panel which has a rubberized matte finish to it. The phone is slim and feels good to hold. You get the feeling of holding a premium phone. The power and volume button are very responsive though they feel a bit wobbly.\n\nPerformance: I couldnt have been happier. The phone is extremely snappy. One of the advantages of running stock, clean android without any gimmicky junk that other OEMs add. Backed by a powerful mid-range processor the snapdragon 400 and 1 gig of RAM, this should suffice for everyday needs with occasional gaming. I tried playing dead trigger 2, which runs smooth 90% of the times and asphalt 8, which I felt it was laggy. But a couple of other reviews showed asphalt 8 running smoothly.\n\nCall quality: I dont tend to get too many voice calls but I am more than satisfied with what the phone offers as I dont have to repeat what I have said to the person on the other end and I can also hear the other person clearly..\n\nStorage: The new moto g comes with 16 gigs of storage and now comes with the ability to expand it via a micro sd card upto 32 gigs. Out of 16 gigs you get about 12-13 gigs of usable space. So I think all your storage needs are covered.\n\nBattery life: Battery life is subjective and depends from person to person. The new moto g has the same battery as that of its predecessor. A non user replaceable 2070 mAh battery. Im a bit surprised that they havent bumped up the battery in proportion to the screen size. But nevertheless im able to squeeze out 7-8 hours of battery on an average with about 2-2.5 hrs of screen on time.\n\nDisplay: The new moto g comes with a 5 inch HD (1280X720P) display. One thing that catches my attention is the incredibly thin bezels. Viewing angles are good, colour reproduction is decent. Watching movies and videos are a pleasure. The phone played almost any video I threw at it. Including a heavily encoded 1080p movie. Though you need to install a 3rd party video app called MX player from google play store.\n\nSound: The new moto g comes with dual front facing stereo speakers and man I must say its a pleasure to hear something play via the speakers. Though not like boom sound of HTC, I must say im more than happy with what motorola is offering. No problems with the ringer as well\n\nCons:\n\nCamera: I think motorola have compromised on the camera, I have no qualms about colour reproductivity, contrast and so on. But the camera struggles to focus many times, very evident when you take close ups. I am coming from the nokia lumia 720 and I am already missing the fantastic camera that it had. The flash is also a disappointment, it doesnt light up the entire frame, the light tends to fade towards the corners of the frame.\n\nConnectivity: The moto g comes with almost every connectivity option including bluetooth and wifi but alas! no NFC. NFC hasnt really picked up in India yet but its a matter of time before it does. I dont think many of you would think of this as a con but IMO this is some form of a compromise and I feel its a con.\n\nSo thats it guys. Hope you liked this honest review. Give me a thumbs up if you liked this review. Cheers!"

Its big and has good colour reproduction and the image quality is best for the price.\n2. The Camera takes more than decent pics.Front camera has better details for selfies Enough details and good colours for casual photography\n3. Video's are good with enough detail though 1080p would make customers more happy( Anyway shooting high quality videos isn't much of a necessity for most people, the default 720p is good enough for your casual functions)\n4. Google now is flawless and phone catches your commands good enough.\n5. Even though the phone has the same S400 chipset the performance is good enough with snappy performance for casual usage. High end and intensive gamers may be satisfied with screen size and performance but the phone would get heated soon.\n6. The default headset is of good quality but its not in-ear and the design awkward. Better buy JBL in-ear headsets than stock\n7. Charger is ok but it gets heated up and cools itself later so dont worry about it.\n8. Use official micro sim rather than using a trimmed sim. My trimmed sim had connectivity issues\n9. A guaranteed L update and a active development community support makes it a better option than most micromaxx, karbon phones (I personally dont prefer the indian branded china sets but its your wish)\n10. The phone has 16GB internal out of which 11-12GB is usable and apps can be moved to SD too. Didn't check OTG.\nSo thats all about my experience with this wonderful budget smartphone. The Phone provides nexus performance and experience at a lower cost. Doesn't has fancy things, but doesn't upsets you much. Its the best ans sensible choice for a casual user on a normal budget"

One of the greatest bombs designed by my beloved Motorola gonna explode and repel samchung a.k.a Crapsung. I am amazed to see how can a company bring vividity to such an extent that it seems like I am using a device equipped with an amoled display. I think Motorola did proper SWOT Analysis before launching Moto G 2nd Generation, that is why there are no shortcomings. Let discuss its pros and cons.\nPros:-\n1) I have never seen such vividness in an ips lcd display.\n2) Colours are well saturated.\n3) Other phones have dedicated app storage but there is no such partition for apps in internal memory, that means you can fully use the internal storage for apps installation i.e 12GB.\n4) This mobile supports microsd slot. That means you can expand its memory as per your need.\n5) I never thought that an android device would be able to stand against my Nokia N8 in terms of sound quality. Being an Audiophile I always try to use the device that can meet my expectations. And believe me it has passed the test by a huge margin.\n6) Dual front speakers give you pleasant experience when you listen or watch any song in landscape mode.\n7) Camera is excellent although not as good as my Nokia N8 but you will definately enjoy its camera quality. Although front camera is only 2mp still it is better than any other 5mp camera of companies like mmx.\n8) Built quality is awesome, I'd say it is close to that of Nokia's built quality.\n9) Corning's Gorilla Glass 3 makes the screen durable, although I didn't perform a drop test but I tried it scratching with knife, screw driver etc. but didn't able to scratch it.\n10) Battery is decent, atleast I am satisfied with its performance.\n11) No matter you are playing a hd game or a basic game, it won't heat-up a bit.\n12) Touch is very smooth.\n13) I have played almost every game on it and it was smooth all over thanks to its powerful cpu and gpu i.e Snapdragon 400 and Adreno 305.\nCons:\n1) Stock earphones are not good, but it doesn't matter I use Sennheiser CX-180.\n2) Charger is weak, it takes almost 3 hours to fully charge. But I use Digiflip 6600 mAH power bank to charge it, as it takes only 1.5 hours to charge my moto.\n3) Pure Android UI is not so user friendly. But still I like it.\nThat's all for now. You can rely on my review. Unbiasness Guaranteed :)"

            "desc": "I have been using the Moto G 2nd Gen for about a week now which, I believe, puts me in a good position to review the phone and talk about my overall experience with it.\n\nBuying Experience:\nThe buying experience was smooth and hassle free. I ordered the phone minutes after it was launched and the site (Flipkart) didn't crash and had thankfully anticipated the demand enough that the phone didn't sell out within minutes! The delivery was done 2 days BEFORE the promised date so all in all, a great job by Flipkart!\n\nFirst Impressions:\nUnbox and you see this slab of glass, simple, sleek and beautiful! Hold the phone and the first thing you realize is that the phone has a very premium hand feel! The build quality is top notch and the design is simple, just how it should be! The sides have a piano black finish which does make the phone a little slippery while holding it. You also notice that the phone is quite big but holding it is comfortable thanks to that curved back and the matte finish of the back panel. The back is plastic but in no way does it feel cheap. You know you've got something that is worth the money that you paid for it!\n\nPros:\n- If there was one feature that shines on the Moto G 2nd Gen, it has to be those front firing stereo speakers! I was blown away by the clarity of those little things! Definitely the best speakers I've heard on any phone!\n- The 5 inch display is great! For watching videos or reading e-books, it seems to be just right.\n- The 8 mp camera is decent. Does what it is told. The camera interface is also surprisingly simple. I am yet to try the camera in different light settings but indoor shots till now have been good enough. The video recording is 720p and can also be done in slow motion. You will enjoy making slow motion videos on the phone! You can also take photos WHILE recording the video. Something that I wasn't expecting to be honest!\n- The phone is dual sim, very very useful for people who are always traveling between two cities! The call quality is crisp, noise cancellation is good.\n- External storage via a microSD card is a major plus that the original Moto G lacked. Along with an SD card slot, the phone also gets USB OTG. So external pendrives can also be connected via an OTG cable. Very handy to carry all your data at all times.\n- The battery lasts me 18 hours with normal usage, 2G internet, auto sync enabled and the screen brightness at 50%. If you use the 'battery saver' mode, the phone easily lasts a day on charge. No complaints there.\n- The OS is the vanilla Android and it is slick with no lags whatsoever. The animations and transitions are smooth, multitasking is a breeze. The phone never seems to struggle even when playing graphics intensive games. Thanks to the stock Android, the phone will be one of the first phones to get the updates. That is a big plus!\n- The Moto G 2nd Gen supports the \"Ok Google\" hot-word from any screen. Basically, once enabled, you can say \"Ok Google\" no matter what you are doing on the phone and Google search immediately comes up asking you what needs to be done. Very nifty and neat!\n- The phone has a water resistant coating inside out. Full marks to Motorola!.\n\nCons:\n- The phone charger! The phone charger is of a low output (550 mA) and because of that, charging the Moto takes a lot of time.\n- Non removable battery. This can be a deal breaker for some people however I don't think much of it.\n- No data cable in the retail box. You need to buy that separately if you don't already own one.\n- The earphones that come out of the box are average in their audio output. People who take their music seriously will have to buy new earphones.\n- No external camera button, something I miss coming from the Lumia family of phones.\n- While not entirely a problem, operating the phone with one hand is usually not possible thanks to its increased size.\n\nCompetition:\nIn the mid level segment, the Moto G 2nd Gen reigns supreme! According to me, it is the best value for money phone in the market. Yes, the Chinese and Indian competitors are offering phones with bumped up specs at lesser price but none can match the Moto in terms of brand value and build quality. Add to that the offering of stock Android with a guaranteed update to Android L and the Moto G 2nd Gen becomes a very good deal!\n\nA special mention of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini, a phone that offers almost the same specifications as the Moto G 2nd Gen BUT costs twice as much! What was Samsung thinking?\n\nThe Moto G 2nd Gen is everything that its predecessor was and then some more! The original Moto G was a brilliant device and the 2nd Gen continues that legacy.\nIf you are in the market on a budget, looking for a no nonsense phone, the Moto G 2nd Gen is your best bet!"

I got this for myself. Here's my views on the various aspects\nForm Factor: I prefer the form factor of the 1st gen Moto G as its easier to use single handed and more pocket friendly.\n\nDisplay: The display of the 1st gen Moto G is brighter, has better sunlight legibility and has more saturated colours. The 2nd gen Moto G display is not as good as the 1st gen one.\n\nStorage: The 2nd gen Moto G is better due to the microSD card slot. This is what prompted me to buy it. I had a few issues migrating data from my Defy Plus. The Migrate app copied all my media files to the internal storage of the Moto G. Then, the Storage setting \"Move media to SD card memory\" didn't move my videos to the SD card. I used ES File Explorer to move my videos from internal memory to the SD card.\n\nCall Quality: Excellent as always with Motorola phones.\n\nGeneral Usage: Smooth like before due to stock Android. I'm not a heavy multi-tasker and 1 GB RAM still seems enough for me.\n\nMedia Consumption: Watching videos and playing games is better on the 2nd gen Moto G due to the bigger screen. Audio quality is good but I'm surprised that PowerAmp sounded better on my Defy Plus. The bundled music player sounds better than PowerAmp on the Moto G. I'm not sold on the stereo speaker functionality in the new Moto G. I think the 2 silver bars just spoil its looks and don't sound as loud in a noisy environment.\n\nCamera: The cameras in the 2nd gen Moto G have been upgraded from the 1st gen one. I haven't extensively tested the camera - its a feature I don't use much. It looks OK to me but I wouldn't be surprised if its not as good as the competition. Motorola has always lagged in the camera department.\n\nBattery Life: The 2nd gen Moto G keeps the same battery as the 1st gen one after increasing the screen size. So, the battery life is not so good, just average.\n\nCharger: Motorola still bundles the same bakwas charger in the new Moto G. No USB cable, only 550mA charging rate. I still use my Defy Plus charger which is much better - has a detachable USB cable and 850mA charging rate.\n\nIn summary, providing expandable memory on the new Moto G was a good move. However, they should have at least put a bigger battery and bundled a decent charger with a detachable USB cable. I would rate it 3.5/5 but I'm rounding it to 4."

Ordered at 12 Midnight and got it by 10 AM....\n\nComing back to Moto G 2nd Gen, phone looks premium and also feels premium. Nice upgrade from Moto G but could have added more juice to battery and display.\n\nPros:\n*Phone look and feel is very good\n*Nice Camera (front & rear)\n*Smooth touch response\n*Lag free processing\n*Awesome speakers and call voice clarity is also very good\n*5 inch screen but still handy to use\n\nCons:\n*Volume & power buttons not handy to press\n*Display is not very sharp as 5 inch but still 720P\n*Battery could have been better, atleast 2500 mAH\n\nOverall the Moto G 2nd Gen is awesome upgrade to its predecessor Moto G except few minor glitch hence rating it 4 stars...!!! If you are looking mid range smart phone this should be considered in top 3 choice's."

As usual ordering and delivery from Flipkart was convenient and super fast. Ordered at 10:45am received at 4:00pm.\n\nComing to the phone itself, the package ships with wired headset(earplug+mic) and a charger with a detachable micro USB cable. Unlike the reviews read online for units sold in Europe, the unit in India ships with Charger and wired headset. Its too early to comment on battery life and charger performance.\n\nScreen is bright and clear - 5\" size is convenient to use as a phone and for internet usage. Inclusion of a microSD card slot is an added advantage over the previous version. The call quality in my limited use till now since laying hands on the phone has been pleasing and very good. The speaker performance is also good. The unit supports dual sim and takes micro SIMs. I have set up SIM1 for my official sim and SIM2 for my personal number and data usage. On the first boot, the unit prompts you asking which of the SIMs you wish to setup for data/interconnect. Yet to test out the camera - but given that its an improvement in specifications over the previous 1st gen Moto G, i expect the camera performance to be good as well. Supports 3G - LTE support is still missing in this version.\n\nThe back side of the phone has kind of smooth matte like finish - its not glossy. Further its not fully flat, but slightly curved at backside. Holding it is comfortable. I felt the phone feels slightly heavy in comparison to having held the Nexus 5, Galaxy Note kind of phones.\n\nNone of the accessories were available at the time of ordering. So the the big sales pitch of 50% off on accessories on the 1st day of ordering was no help.\n\nCould not notice any annoying cons till now. Shall update this review after a few days of usage. Overall an excellent value for money budget phone that does not skimp on features. So far well pleased with what I paid for."

Was very exited to get the phone..\nI have the moto g(1st gen) as well.\n\n1) After i received the the new phone i unboxed it and the 1st thing i did was to switch on the phone.. i noticed that the power & volume buttons were not up to the mark in terms of build quality when compared to the earlier moto g that i have.\n\n2)After the phone was booted the phone seemed fine in terms of display. But in comparison with the earlier moto g, i played a same HD video on both phones simultaneously. As expected the video, the video quality on the moto g2 was not great due to the resolution of this phone.. The viewing angles on the earlier moto g was very good due to its higher ppi..!! The color contrast on the new moto g is not as good as the earlier moto g as well.\n\n3)The 3rd point that i noticed on the new moto g2(2nd gen) was, when i put both the phones (both moto g & g2) on AUTO brightness mode the new phone's screen looked very dull in comparison with the moto g. The earlier moto g is very bright and crisp.\n\n4)The new moto g2 feels really good to hold in hand and feels lighter but its actually little heavier than the old one.\n\n5)The camera is pretty good on the g2. The flash on the older moto g was lot brighter than the new one..\n\n6)Sound quality is pretty good on the moto g than the g2.\n\n7)The SD card slot is a major advantage in the g2. After using it for couple of days its showing SD card damaged. The camera and gallery did not open itself when i had put the SD card.. Dont know if the device that I have has an issue or all of them r facing the same issue. I switched off the phone, put the sd card again n rebooted it. It worked fine. There is some issue with the SD card slot.. Needs a fix !!\n\nOverall it a pretty ok phone for 13k but could have been a lot better in terms of the hardware specs..!!\n\nAlso i like the way Flipkart ships the products :) Delivery & support is good !!"

            "desc": "First of all, great service from Flipkart who delivered 2 days before the estimated date. The package arrived in the best condition with the manufacturer's seal intact. I am waiting for the accessories to be available so that I can buy some of them.\n\nAnyways, before I talk about the phone, let me tell you where I come from. I have been a steady fan of Nokia Symbian phones and have been extremely skeptical of Android and the phones they come in. I have been using a Nokia 5800 for many years and then I had tried the Sony Xperia Mini for some time and I didn't like it(very low battery performance and too buggy android). So, I had moved back to Nokia Symbian by buying the Nokia 808 Pureview and had been using it for the last couple of years. So, finally after hearing so much good info about Motorola phones as well as the new Android versions, I decided to give it a try and since google owns Motorola now(although temporarily), and since the technical specs to price ratio is insanely on the good side for consumers, I bought this new Moto-G.\n\nFirst impressions. This phone is big with a big screen. My earlier 808 was of size 4-inch and for some strange reason I expected the Moto-G to be not different by this much. Anyways, this size is the maximum I can handle for a phone, at-least based on my palm size. People with bigger hands will find this more comfortable to use. The 720p display looks good. I have seen Sony's much hyped Triluminous Bravia powered display when I saw the Xperia Z Ultra at a store. The Moto-G's screen appears to be just as good, especially when you crank up the brightness. Everything is perfectly clear and sharp and unless I look at it closely with a lens, I would say this phone's display is as good as apple's retina display. The touch response is very quick with latency thats almost as low as the iOS devices(try playing drum apps in both and you'll see what I mean).\nThe body of the phone appears to be well built and sturdy unlike the previous android phone that I owned(same price) and one thing to note here is that the whole body is dust and finger-print resistant. Motorola claims to have the gorilla glass 3 with this phone. Looks like thats good too (Accidently put the phone in my pocket with my car keys and not a single dent or scratch) :) The battery appears to last as Motorola claims, unlike what I heard with the first generation Moto-Gs. I hope its not because this is the early days since purchase :)\n\nPerformance. There is a big surprise here for me atleast. The data transfer between your external micro-SD card and the internal memory happens at 20MB/s. I saw this when I tried copying my music from my micro-SD card to the internal memory so as to format the card using the phone. The stock android doesn't come with a file manager in this phone. So, I use this 3rd party file manager called ES File Explorer. The quad-core CPU appears to be great giving no lags on HD video playback and gaming. Although I wouldn't recommend trying to run big uncompressed HD videos as it can't handle it. For gaming, I tried running NFS hot Pursuit and it worked great. Works exactly as how it does in my iPad. Android Kitkat is way better in terms of performance than Jelly Bean or ICS and that transcends complemented by the quad-core CPU.\n\nSo, to conclude, the 2nd Gen Moto-G is the best phone you can ever get for that price in the market. No other phone in that price range is even close. So, its a must buy for anyone who is looking for a decent android based smart-phone. I mean, based on what I see here, one has to be almost crazy to go for the high-end models from leading manufacturers that are priced atleast 4-5 times the price of this phone. It really shows how cheap the technology really is and how most manufacturers are overcharging for their products."

My old phone Galaxy s lcd had better headset undoubtedly. Most of the customers would be disappointed with this quality of headset. Quality of audio is very less & sometimes i find it difficult to realise which song is playing while I am riding on my two wheeler.\nBut moto backs it up by beautiful front stereo speakers, they are absolutely brilliant & enjoyed every bit of it.\n\nYes charger do get heated up a bit but folks if u had used samsung phones previously use samsung charger to charge the moto I have personally checked the capacity of both samsung & moto charger & both supply same amount of power or less (in case of samsung) u can check the spcifications on ur chargers. & guess what phone doesn't get heated up when charged by samsung charger. I have been doing it from last 9 days.\n\nBattery is pretty decent & it comes for a whole day with normal usage. I get a back up of almost a day which is fine for me. however one can change thier runtime from dalvik to ART in developer options for better battery response.\n\nDual sim for those who love to have two sims & both work pretty well, signal strength is also very good. It also comes with the micro sd slot so more soace for heavy storage.\n\nCamera also works very well both rear & front camera photos looked much better in non HDR mode (personal preference) It also supports 720p video recording & it also boosts slow motion video 2 720p which is quiet awesome.\n\nOverall I really like the new moto g & i have enjoyed every bit of it."

The phone is super awesome as the moto-g(1st Gen) and the cam quality had been increased a lot and thats a very good job done in this phone. I have purchased a moto-g for myself and a moto-e for my mom and now i have purchased this new edition for my bro. Now my whole family is holding moto devices. We are all very happy using the device. I have been using my moto-g from 9 months( i have purchased the global gsm version in US) and seriously there wasnt even a small glitch and the same from moto-e from 4 months and same continues with the new moto-g i hope so. Regarding the specs i dont need to say much everything is perfectly blend for this price range and handset. May be there might be companies offering you other features or increased capabilty but i am sure that for the price we paid this moto-g lasts long than other devices.. People who want quality , performance , proper service, battery life, connectivity and pure android experience this is the best buy at this price range. Flipkart u always make me happy. Ordered at 9:32 AM on 6th sept got it delivered by 6:20PM on 7th sept with no extra cost( BGLR-HYD). Kudos to flipkart.\n\nThe only problem is the cost of the back panels. If they are reduced to a large extent then many would opt buying original shells or cases."

(-0.5)\nHeadphone looks very avg so i did not even bothered to try them out.\n\n3) DESIGN- 5 star no doubt about it, the phone as soon as i took out of the box fell in love with it. M using nexus 4 right now, and this phone is so light and feels safer in hand, the back panel (white) is rubber type material which is good, will avoid finger print marks. although the weight is also an issue coz at times i felt like its a TOY rather than a phone.\n\n4) Display- same a prev moto G. I am happy with the display with the amount of money i paid\n\n5) Storage- 5 star for adding External storage. 32GB\n\n6) Camera - Disappointed, 8MP, u kidding me. My very OLD Samsung S2 took amazing pics with 8MP. its more of a 3mp camera.\nThe images are whitish and washed out. the front cam is even worse. could have been way better.\n\n7) BATTERY- charging is looking slow to me, will wait and watch how it goes.\n\n8) Performance - Its Stock android and with Quad core 400 chip, its working better than i expected. no lag, and very smooth . though i dont like the 4.4 icon in app drawer. looks to big\n\n9) Sound- Sound are really good, front facing dual speaker are just very well tuned.\n\n10) call reception- its funny that people now talk and concern about call quality in the end, well my first call came from home, and mothers voice always sound great. call quality is really good :)\n\n11) Net speed: Slow on wifi , will have to check how 3G works.\n\n12) RESULT : 4 start out of 5 and +0.5 for the awesome back panel curve design. For me looks matter 70% in a phone and 30% specs. so Thums up for Moto G.\n\nSurely it do not match with 14000 xiomi mi3, but i did not like that phone design and its stupid to first register than wait and try to book at 2pm...its just crappy process. its just a phone not my life,,so will pass mi2 for now,,,\n\nhope you guys find it useful."

I myself searched through an amazing range of choices, but in the end decided for MotoG2 for the simple reason that the quality does matter over specs.... The phone definitely looses out to competition on the point of lesser ram, older processor, lesser PPI and smaller battery capacity.... but it all becomes meaningless as soon as you start the phone... Its a fab product with no lag, very easy to use... simple, clean and very functional interface both physical and software wise... battery life has been good so far.... camera does its job nice but could definitely have been better..... I have been a very heavy and advanced user of phones (some of them have been of the highest specs) and now all I want from my phone is to have a responsive, functional and usable experience with a good camera and good battery while not burning my purse... in that respect, nobody can beat this phone at this price.....\nwould highly recommend this phone if that's wat you are looking for....."

Besides that here are some points,\n1. In the box we don't get USB which is an important part. The wire of charger is non-detachable. Besides that the charger is of very low quality. It takes 5:30 hours to charge the phone. whereas the device is fully charged in 2 hours by samsung or sony charger.\n2. Earphones are worth rupees 100/- in local market. Completely absurd earphones.\n3. Performance is not upto the mark. Its being 10 days after using the phone and the device hangs sometimes.\n4. Touch is sticky. While swiping, any unwanted app or anything gets open due to sticky touch.\n5. No direct Music access. For direct shortcut you have to make a playlist in google music and then in widgets the shortcut for playlist is available.\n6. Browsing experience is horrible in google chrome.\n7. Keyboard is bad (it may be bad for me only). I am using Swift keyboard now.\n8. No inbuilt file manager. Must be downloaded from playstore.\n9. I have left spending time on facebook through app bcoz its horrifying. ( That is an advantage actually ;) )\n\nso in my opinion Samsung S3 neo is far better than this device.The all above cons are absent in S3. I have used S3 neo for 1 year and it never hanged, NEVER. After using moto g, s3 neo looks like an under-priced phone with lot of features, attractive interface and accessibility and most important, ease of handling."

So my obvious choise stands for 5 inch handset which I am use to for a longer period in form of Xperia Z1. I decided to go for Moto G2 (especially to use pure android with LOLLIPOP).\nPros:\n1)Design- I am totally amazed with its look and feel superb to hold in hand. the curve back panel looks premium and makes it quiet distintict from other cheap phones.\n2)Processor- Snapdragon 400 chipset @ clock speed of 1.2 Ghz with Only 1 GB RAM. Though the Moto G2 runs flawless on above chipset but it could have been better by improving clock speed and SD 410 chipset. The RAM optimisation is quiet brilliant, u will get almost 500 MB RAM free on top of of Lollipop.\n3) Camera: The rear cam is equiped with 8 MP and front is 2 MP. Both takes descent pics but u get some noisiness in captured pics when zoomed in. I slightly disapoint with it becouse Lenovo A6000 takes much brighter and noiseless pictures.\n4) Screen: the 5 inch HD screen is brighter and balanced color productive. it is also protected by corning gorilla glass3 and eliminated with water coating.\n5)Sound; The front faces dual sterio speaker gives a loud amount of sound. The phone quality is also loud so you can hear properly in traffic and noisy area.\n6)Battery: The battery backup is little disapointed me, its hardly sustain for a day. only 8-9 hours of backup you will get after moderate usase.\n7)Storage: you are getting 12.8 MB inbuilt storage out of 16 GB and it can be expandble to #@ GB via MSD card. So Here you cant ask for more.\n8)Operatin Sys.: The Lollipop update makes it Ice on the cake. The moto Assist and Other lollipop features makes it Premium device.\nVerdict- I reviewed it after using 10 days and in my opinion if your budget is 10 to 12K then go for it despite of other cheap mobiles which promisses excellent on the paper but fail to deliver.\n1* star reduced for Camera......otherwise the phone stands taller in every aspect of the features......."

But Moto g2 I ordered came with Android L directly and no where in the Motorola or Flipkart website it is mentioned. (I do not have issues with phones per-installed with Android L, but no where it is mentioned for Moto G2 and hence that gives boost for my claim).\n\n* Product seal is of very poor quality, anyone can tamper and stick it back as it was earlier. It's like a normal cello tape with Motorola logo in it!!\n\n* Call clarity is not good, speaker is faulty with a background buzzing noise. I tried by disabling stereo output, flipkart technician suggested to change the cellular provider and test, this option did not give promising results either. Even a phone restore suggested by flipkart technician did not yield any good result.\n\n* My initial request for replacement was rejected as they suggested me to restore the device.

It's simple and fun.\n- 16GB total Internal space out of which around 12GB is available to the user. Thumbs up!

            "desc": "Great Product from Motorola. Has everything needed in a budget phone. Specs are already given so I won't describe them again here. Comes with Android Lollipop (5.0.2) out-of-the-box. Minor Bugs in the OS ,, nothing alarming, an update from google will fix this.. still awaiting for that.\n\nVerdict: Everything works fine and great. Except for the battery backup.. but it is expected from 2070mAH battery. It heats up if you have multiple things working together, especially with mobile data / hotspot on. Donot switch on wifi hotspot and charge, causes fast heat up.. and that too to very high temperature (That's why 4 Star Rating). If this issue is fixed then its awesome!\n\nBought the phone during March 23-25 sale. Got it for Rs.9899/- (Rs.2000/- flat off + 10% extra off with AXIS bank Debit Card).\n\nMust buy Items with Phone:\n1. Good Quality Matte Screen Protector. (Go for Matte because clear doesn't suit well with this phone)\n2. A good quality back cover.. probably Nillkin.\n3. 16 GB external SD card or above.. (SanDisk UHS class 10 should do fine).\n4. If you're a frequent traveler or do not usually have access to electricity outlets, I recommend you to buy a Power bank (6000mAH or higher.. Ambrane or Xiaomi should do fine).\n[All the mentioned items are available at flipkart itself.]\n\nOther Improvements are left to your choice and Customization.\n\nKudos to Flipkart and its team: right from placing the order to delivery. Everything was smooth as butter. No wonder they're dominating the online shopping market in India. As a Bangalorean myself I'm proud about this establishment.\n\nEnjoy this product."

The problems I face after the lollipop update often make me want to forget about the money i have sent on the phone and get a new one. Here's a list of the issues:\n*Phone stops making calls. Tapping on call - whether in the dialler or anywhere will not work. You have to restart teh phone, sometimes more than once.\n*You get locked out. The unlock screen will not appear. You can sometimes get in by double-tapping a notification and bringing up an unlock screen then.\n*It often slows down enormously and won't open things, hangs, arbitrarily closes apps.\n*It often drops data.\n\nThat's a lot of horrible things. But I have to admit, it *was* quite good until Lollipop update. if you buy it don't upgrade, and get a battery pack.

The sound quality is below average which I did not expect. I used Samsung ear phones with this phone and the sound was much better.\n2) Initially the charger used to get too hot when the phone is kept for charging. So hot that you freak out that it might blast off. Several others reported this in their reviews too. However in the past few days I see that it is normal (Surprisingly).\n3) Thumbs down for BATTERY backup. Should have been better.\n4) The back cover quality is cheap in Moto G g2. Moto X has a very strong back cover. Moto G g1's back cover was strong enough too.\nOther than these, the phone is excellent in terms of display, dual speakers, camera, videos, latest OS updates.... blah blah\nI would recommend this product to a friend.

I would rather not write much about the product as my Flipkart Mates have written very good reviews about this product.\n\nGo for it, if you are crazy about the android updates, features because Moto will let us enjoy the features which releases from the Android."

Was starting to get used to the phone when I realised that there is intermittent static disturbance in all calls made. Tried using same sim with other phones, call quality was perfect. So, poor call quality was a very huge let down. Moreover, this new phone with lollipop updated (as given by flipkart) drops wifi signal every 15-20 mins and remembered wifi networks also have to be connected manually as it shows 'authentication problem'. This problem is faced by many after the latest update.\n\nThus, my luck was not so good both the times and now I'm struggling to get a refund and go for another handset as I don't wanna keep trying my luck. Nevertheless, my friends still have the same phone working very smoothly\n\nMy advice: If you are feeling adventurous and trust your luck, order it. If it works well, its a steal.

This may be reason for over gaming or over charging but playing clash of clan, candy crush like cos this over heating than it would be serious issue. Even than charging is not lasting long under Wifi or Gaming like asphalt 8 for 1 hour leads to 40%-50% drop in battery.

            "desc": "After going through all the great reviews, I bought a Moto G 2nd gen in an exchange offer. I asked for a replacement as the device had some problems. IS IT TRUE that what we get as a replacement will be a refurbished phone? Those products you offer on sale ARE ACTUALLY REFURBISHED? For example, you sell Nokia Lumia 1020 anywhere from 14,000 to 50,000. Shall I assume that products sold on discounts, exchange offers are refurbished and those failed quality tests?\n\nI got to know what exactly 'mass hysteria' is all about. This phone definitely is not as good as it is made out to be. Firstly, it was projected as a great phone. 'Word of mouth' made it a great phone. Those who bought this phone were kind of left with no choice but to tell others that this is a great phone. Most importantly, no one wants TO ADMIT THAT his/her phone is not really a good phone. This general psychology of human beings worked for Moto G 2nd Gen.\n\nPros:\n\nGood looks, Good build Quality\n\nCons:\n\n1. Black mobile comes with white charger and a white headset. If you have aesthetic sense, you will agree that these accessories don't go well with the phone. Headset is of cheap quality. You can buy a better headset from pavement sellers. The charger is just 550 mAh which is not enough to charge your phone quickly. I noticed that it takes approximately 8 hours to fully charge the device. And the battery drains so fast that it will not last for 8 hours even if you are a light user.\n\n2. Worst thing about this mobile is that it gets heated up even if you download few apps or a video. When I first booted this device, I synced my google account. So, about 20 apps started downloading. In 15 min, the device became so hot that the chrome bar over the earpiece could easily have burned skin on my ears. Immediately, I asked for a replacement. Flipkart called me and told me that if my battery temperature is more than 45 degrees, they will consider it as a heating issue. I tested again just know what would be the battery temperature. I have done the factory reset and downloaded all those apps again.Battery was at 76 degrees. Somehow they agreed to replace my phone.\n\n3. Camera isn't great either. I took few snaps in daylight. Color reproduction was good. But when I zoomed in there were no details. Photos under low light really suck.\n\n4. It definitely lags some times. Touch would not work sometimes.\n\n5. I tested how WiFi works on this device. I started downloading Asphalt 8 on this mobile and my iPad at the same time. My pad managed download the game (1.5 GB) in about 10 mins. This phone took nearly 3 hours to download the game on the same WiFi network.\n\nVerdict: All that glitters is not gold"

I even doubt if they vl post this review.\n\nOrdered Moto G on Jan 20th under In a day guarantee as I am a flipkart first customer & payment was done through EMI option & there was a discount of rs.1300 on my card. 2 hours later I wanted to change the address & called customer care regarding this. They said they cannot deliver under in a day and said it would be normal dlivery process as the pincode is not covered under in a aday delivery. I agreed for that. On 21st they cancelled my order without my consent & sent a mail saying their courier partner cannot deliver. Problems started after this as 21 was the billing date of my credit card. As it was purchased under EMI I had no option to cancel the EMI.\n\nIn the meantime the order was cancelled 4 times, cancellation was cancelled twice, refund done twice. Finally received the item on 30th Jan.\n\nFlipkart customer care(care?? do they really?) is really disgusting and annoying. they told so many lies. They told they vl speak to bank n cancel the EMI n refund the money to my card!! N some one said the product is out of stock n negotiations are goin on with WS retail to get it in stock!! About delivery dates they gave, less said the better. All they vl do is try to convince the customer by tellin cock n bull(shit) stories n say they have forwarded it to the concerned department which is dead I guess as nothing ever happened. Even they went to the extent of asking me to pay the EMI irrespective of the delivery of the product!!\n\nBeware guys. Dont fall for the nice words n false promises. They dont give a shit about customers. Once your money is with them u r screwed. They wont even respond to your mails. They wont commit to delivery dates by sending any mail. They vl just say it verbally. If u cal them thn they vl convince u. Thats it. They wont solve ur problem. They never bother abt customers. So I advice u to demand a mail for thr commitments n do not disconnect the cal unless u get a mail from them.\n\nFlipkart learn some ethics. You are here coz of the customers. Stop fooling them. I am really disappointed for being a Flipkart First customer by paying Rs.500. Your customer care is so so annoying and disappointing. Not at all service oriented. Just tryin to convince the customer for the blunders u make."

It fits easily in hands even it has 5 inch display. Motorola designed it very nicely. Two front speakers are loud enough but not expect too much( it's not a chinese phone :P). Back cover is rubberised and not slippery at all, edges are curved and smooth and grip is tight. It is only a little bigger than my lumia 720.So don't think it is very big phone and it'll not fit in your pocket.\n\n2nd come to the OS, when it was delivered, first thing I did that I upgraded it to lollipop. but honestly it is not good as compare to kitkat. I've used kitkat in micromax canvas A1 and that was really good one.Yeah lollipop has some animations and good interface than kitkat but in some aspect like menu and search engine goes white which I don't like. there's lot of problem in network connectivity which is very slow to connect and in my phone it doesn't show H+ only H or E. It is not very big problem but sometimes you cannot judge the exact spped of the network.\n\n3rd is about perfomance. I strictly don't advice this one for heavy gamers. I played riptide gp2, contract killer, aspalt 8 and dead trigger. I found these games little laggy when compared to my canvas A1 which is very smooth compared to moto g2 in gaming performance. If you are not intersted in big games or if subaway surfer temple run are enough for you then you won't found any problem. Otherwise phone is very smooth and touch is too.\n\n4th is display. No match in this range. Colourful, natural and Crisp, Not like samsung phones which has over saturated display.touch is very responsive and buttery smooth.\n\n5th is camera. Don't except too much. I've lumia 720 which has 6.7 MP camera but far better than moto g2's 8 MP. but I don't want to say G2's camera is bad. if u want a camera phone go for lumia 730, you'll get better camera performance and camera app too and if you are not intersted in windows what can I say. :p\n\n6th now come to the battery performance. Not bad at all. just turn off the mobile data when you're not using it. you'll get full day backup. In mix usage like net surfing and gaming I've no problem in battery backup. It's sufficient for an android phone which has 5 inch display so don't think childish like It has to give 2-3 day backup and bla bla.\n\nP.S.- If you want a good looking phone with best diplay in its class and stock android experience. Just go for it. I always prefer stock even in windows:p Not think for some UI and touchwiz which can only reduce your phone's performance. Good luck!!!"

There are several visible changes with Lollipop that require a few minutes of unlearning and learning. The update was very big though (around 360-370 MB). Fortunately, the phone is still working fine after the update :-)\n\nI purchased the phone under exchange scheme last week. Also got 10% cashback for credit card. Overall, was a good deal (though I still mourn my Huawei Ascend G510) for around 10K.\n\nPrior to owning this phone, my previous phones had slower processors and 512 or lesser RAM. This phone has slightly better processor and around 850-900 MB RAM (couldn't determine exact RAM because it shows values between 850 to 880 MB, and Motorola claims 1 GB of RAM). Despite this difference between actual and claimed RAM, there is no lag while doing usual operations on phone.\n\nOne thing that I liked about this phone is that it doesn't get heated while charging or while using Wi-Fi or playing games (my previous phones suffered from this problem).\n\nCamera quality is good though I noticed minor lag in adjusting focus.\n\nOne can argue about getting a plain-vanilla phone (Moto G) at a higher price than some fancy phone like Redmi Note or 1S (both with better specs on paper). I feel it is better to stick to a well-known brand. I have heard a couple of negative comments about Service Centers of Motorola, but I have not yet experienced them myself.\n\nOne major negative for this phone is the absence of USB data cable. The charger has fixed wires (unlike other phones where charger cable doubles up as data cable). I believe it doesn't cost much for Motorola to include a USB data cable.\n\nAbout Flipkart's delivery - while these guys are really fast in delivering the items, they don't send proper info on SMS (to reschedule delivery or to enquire more). I got an SMS a day after ordering the phone and the delivery guy was already at my doorstep. Since I was at work, he returned later evening to deliver. It would have been better if Flipkart had sent me Cellphone number of delivery boy or he would have called me prior to visiting my home."

Being an average user (45-60 mins a day) I haven't had any issue with the phone so far. The speed is good despite having multiple apps open. Downloads happen quickly and the memory space is enough. Photo quality is good except on a couple of occasions when it was shaky. I just wish the battery lasted a bit longer than a day with the Internet on."

            "desc": "I am writing this review after using the phone for 2 months:\n\nDesign:\nLooks very premium, probably a metal strip would have enhanced the look. But the feel of the product is very good and it sits anywhere very comfortably, whether in your palm, pocket, or in the provided space in the car. The rubbery effect of the back cover prevents it from slipping away from hand.\n\nDisplay:\nNot the greatest, especially in the outdoors. But do we necessarily look at the screen in bright sunlight. Probably if we are looking at the screen 30 times a day during receiving a call, only 5 will be in the bright sunlight. But the display handles the broad daylight well, although it does not shine admirably.\n\nBuilt:\nVery strongly built. I have a feeling that even if it slips away and falls with a thud, it wount break into pieces. In fact the built has a certain shock absorbing quality, which makes it one of the most strong products in the market. The next stronger phone would be a land line handset.\n\nSoftware and UI:\nIt is a pure Android Kit Kat latest version phone. So there is nothing to talk about. My advice to the users will be not to download loads of unnecessary software from the play store, which you will rarely use. This will prevent the phone from slowing down. A phone is like any other machine. Overloading will always stress any phone system and the system may fail, whether it is the most expensive phone or the cheapest. And after all , we don't buy a phone and then test its durability and smartness by overloading it with tasks. Multitasking is a word coined by the marketing people and people who write dictionaries. For a phone, its not a necessary function. Its just there so that only a few of us, who cannot finish our tasks, can do multitasking.\n\nCall quality:\nExcellent. But sometimes it is just not there. There is silence. I am yet to understand whether it is because of the phone, or the network. My bet would be it is due to network\n\nConnections:\nI use 3G continuously. The connection is fast, even at very remote areas as far as far flung villages of Assam, I got top connection. But again, that could be due to good network, combined with a good grip of the phone over that network. Blue tooth, WiFi, all work perfectly well\n\nBattery:\nThe most important aspect of a smartphone nowadays is its battery. I use another phone with over 4000mah battery. It never sleeps. It keeps going. But It cannot perform like Moto G. Moto G's performance, in respect of the battery that it uses, it nearly enough. But instead of the resent 2010 battery, Moto G could have put a 2500 battery.\n\nBut there are ways you can increase the life of the battery of Moto G. Log off from all unnecessary prgrammes, which you dont need 24 hours to run, like facebook, instagram, twitter etc. Switch off location service. Dont go to known places with the Google Map on. Do not navigate to a place which you already know.\n\nIf you do all these , you will be able to talk, sms and WhatsApp as much as possible, including keep your email services running. You may increase the sync period of the emails tough. It will save a little more of your battery.\n\nWith these, and not harming any of my business activity by logging off from unnecessary synching, I use the phone from early morning till 10.30 in the night. Go to sleep after that.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT:\nReliability. Many do not look for this. But my advice to you would be to look for extreme reliability of a product and the manufacturer's company background in terms of customer service. Motorola love themselves. And they will not let you down on the reliability factor. So if you have not yet bought this Moto G, Go for it. You will be a very happy phone user."

Because of its 1 gb ram and not so great RAM management, it was very aggressive in killing the background applications. Sometimes it used to happen that I am making some payment through the chrome browser and when I switch to messaging app to see the OTP password and then switch back to Chrome, the payment page used to get refreshed and the whole thing had to be repeated again. It was frustrating.\nRecently I had bought Moto G 2nd generation and the same multitasking problem is present in this phone as well (as the RAM and RAM management is same as the 1st generation).\n\nAnother major issue I have found with 2nd generation which was not present in the earlier version is its battery life. The phone drains quite a lot of battery power even when it is idle. On checking which apps are draining the battery, I found that Cell Standby is taking lot of juice out of it (next to Screen - which obviously is the top battery consumer). So when you take your phone in the morning you will find that the battery is several notches down from what you left it in the night.This drainage issue was not there in the 1st gen. I think, there is some software issue related to this and if Motorola is listening (as it has been highlighted by many users in the official Motorola forums) then it should be rectified in the next software update. All said and done, the phone can still manage to get you through a normal day of usage.\n\nSo all in all, Moto G 2nd gen still remains the best phone to buy in this budget with some issues related to multitasking ability and battery life. No other complaints till now even after using the Moto G for more than 10 months (1st and 2nd gen combined)"

I purchased this devices on 14th Dec 14 and the issues that I am facing with the product are:\n1. There is a slight dent on the left hand side of the phone from day one. Immediately bought a cover from Flipkart itself and started using the same.\n\n2. Phone started lagging a lot and I reset the phone. Still occasional lags can be seen.\n3. Battery sucks big time on this particular device. Have to charge atleast 3 times a day with only mail and call usage. My previous Moto G's (have had 3 before) gave me a day's battery life.\n\n4. Occasional heating of the phone.\n\n5. Display quality is worse than previous Moto G 2014's.\n\nI had raised a replacement request with Flipkart on 19th Dec 14 and they assured they will call me on 19th Dec itself. No call but I received SMS that they tried reaching me. All lies. I was in network full day and didn't receive any calls.\n\nA call to customer care has assured me of a call today. No calls yet. Bad service FLIPKART to your Flipkart First Subscriber. Check my records and you will find my shopping history with you.\n\nHence, think twice before you purchase this device, specially the new lot. Check for dents on the metal part right at the beginning.\n\nUpdate: FlipKart called up and did what was needful. Thanks FLIPKART!!!"

After few minutes / seconds, it goes back to Vibrate mode automatically.\n4. You cannot delete selective messages in a specific conversation. I had this feature in a different mobile which i bought three years back.\n5. You cannot delete all the contacts in one go. :((((( that's horrible. I didn't see the feature.\n6.

However, the motherboard to the new phone crashed within 1 and half month of receipt of the replaced phone rendering me handicap and phoneless..\nThereafter, I requested flipkart guys to replace the phone as I have never heard of the incident that a motherboard crashing of a brand new phone.\nAfter writing several emails to flipkart, they finally decided to reply to my email saying they will revert in 2 days which needless to say they conveniently slip the deadline and did not revert.And on being inquired again they only repeatedly gave me the option of taking my phone to he service centre and that they cannot offer me any more assistance than this very curtly put across to me.\nWorst is my phone is now lying with the service centre for more than 10 days and every time i visit them they tell me that they will take 2 more working days as they do not have the required part and the same has to be imported from USA. There are nearly 6 service centres in Mumbai with none possessing the required part. Because of he whole fraud committed by this platform which encourages vendors to sell defective phones I am rendered handicap without a phone and regretful of my idea of buying a phone online from this website ...

Trust me it is or check Moto G 2 Vs. iPhone 6 Video in Youtube(Moto G 2 is fast as per that video). Great for games.\n\nScreen - its a 5\" screen and its so clear when it comes to camera or videos. Its great to see a video or play games.\n\nSim - Dual Sim works fine, also with 3G(for 1st sim only) and 2G. (2nd sim doesn't support 3G).\n\nSpeakers - Its really loud. The person next to you can hear what the person at the other end of the call is speaking with you if the volume is 100% so check your phone volumes or check if any person is next to you ;)\n\nInbuilt Apps - we can move apps to SD card or delete which is not required except few google apps.\nGood to handle, cant expect a better phone for this price.\n\nDisadvantages - which we can see normally in other smartphones as well\n\nBattery - this is also cool I use the wifi or internet almost 18hours a day and battery lasts for 1 day, I would suggest you guys to download the battery doctor app which helps a bit. Initially it was draining out bit fast but after 3-5 days it got adjusted and it lasts for a day. please judge on the battery after 3-5 days of your buying.\n\nHeating problems - I do not see any such issues, charger was getting heated up initially but now I do not see such problems and never faced this with the phone.\n\nI was confused if I should buy a Moto G 2 or Micromax canvas Nitro. But I am really happy with Moto G 2 its so cool. everyone who sees it asks for it ;) If you confused which one to buy I would say go for Moto G 2nd Gen. Anytime google phone rocks."

With 3G, I get 12-15 hours without any fuss. With WiFi, its even more. There is also a default batter saver option in Settings. Switch that on.\nAlso, adjust the screen brightness when you're outdoors and indoors. Sometimes the Auto brightness indoors is quite bright and you don't require so much brightness indoors.\n\nI use the phone a lot including media player in a day. If I remove my phone from charging at 9 in the morning, I charge it again next morning around 7/8am.\n\nThis phone is very good. Not much different from the First Gen. The only thing better is the camera and the screen size. Otherwise, its just like the first gen. And we all know how good the first gen is.\n\nI dont want to comment on the specs as they're similar to the First Gen. The camera though is quite good, in low light too. Front camera is also great in low light.\n\nThe phone comes with stock Android. So that's another plus.\n\nI read some reviews which described the battery life as poor, hence i was skeptical before i could purchase this. But once I bought it, I have no regrets.\nYes, there will be some handsets with some issues, but you cannot get 100% efficiency in anything.\n\nI would totally recommend this phone for anyone looking for high end low budget smartphone.

On calling the Service center (Bell and tell Teleservices) we were informed to get the phone to service center. After 1 day, service center informed that the display was damaged due to physiscal damage. Flipkart informed that the warranty cannot be claimed as it was due to physical damage. Neither the service center nor Flipkart is able to prove the physical damage. Me being the owner of the phone, it is only me who knows if the phone had a physical damage or not.

Back cover is so durable and more easy to open than a bottle cap!!!! it is sealed from inside out making it water and dust resistant to an extent. If you take the white version of this phone you will need a phone cover to protect it from stains! but you can open the phone back cover anytime and wash it and put it back :D\n\nScreen: Corning gorilla glass 3 is something you may not believe before seeing. its smoother than ice but harder than past gorilla glasses. Still i use a Matte finish screen guard just for the looks it provide.\n\nphone booting time: 28 secs generally.\nphone power off time:13 secs generally.\n\nPhone accessibility: U.I is very smooth as it runs on Stock Android 4.4.4 as on Nexus phones only. no default file manager app. No notepad app. so many basic apps miss out in stock android. You will have to download them. 3G is very fast esp in Vodafone and airtel in cities. Navigation is smooth. music player is fluid except it interrupts for 0.5 secs when you tilt the phone from vertical to horizontal positions or vice versa. call facility is fluid. so is messaging. Notifications panel is nice to work with. but notification light is dull compared to blackberry's. sometimes you may face problems with receiving calls as the 'slide-n-answer' feature does not work at times but its very rare. I am trying to find out why it happens.\n\nSound: Very LOUD!\n\nCamera: 8Mp is like Lumia's 5Mp. so nothing much to jump for! but front camera of 2Mp is good.\n\nBattery: 2070 mAh. With D.U Battery app it gives you more or less 1 day/24 Hours backup. please charge your phone for 8 hours after buying as they say if you want proper backup.\n\nMy Review is based on more than two weeks usage so it may vary at some points with others."

I ordered the device 4-5 days before diwali, the expected delivery time was 10 days due to festive season, but it was delivered to me in 3 days, surprisingly. i also ordered a moto g back case along with it which arrived the a day after that.\n\nMoto G is a very well designed and thought out phone. I have handed it over to many of my not-so-Tech-aware friends, and they thought it was one more of those 30K phones with large screens. There's the look factor.\n\nAs far as performance is concerned: I switched from an iPhone 4S to Moto G, so just comparing the two phones - I find Moto G much faster and crisper in terms of the interface.\n\nFrom an Android vs iOS perspective, there's just so much more you can do with Android than iOS. Apps like Whatsapp, PushBullet and Good work so much well on Android due to the deeper integration possible in the Android. Not to mention the whole issue with downloading songs using iTunes into iOS, which is such a buzzkill.\n\nI am a big supporter of low-end phones like Moto G now (coming from a person who has been using Apple since >3 years). The high end phones are not worth it. They will give you the following things for 15K more of money.\n1. NFC - Hardly accessible in India\n2. 4G LTE - Not widely available in India - prices still high\n3. Higher resolution - I mostly use my phones for reading news articles and watching HD videos- There is no need for full HD resolution in both - The internet bandwidth in India is hardly conducive to Full HD videos\n4. Better battery life - I think this is the only thing in the list I would actually pay for. But in the end the trade-off comes to be like 500-800 more of mAh vs Rs. 15K. I think you could get a portable power bank for Rs. 3-4K (the best one in the market). So still Moto G wins.\n\nBest of luck. There's more to life than spending on extravagant phones. Play smart. Hello Moto."

Phone screen turns hot while watching a video for few seconds. Phone usually heats up during potential activities like using camera, on call, watching videos etc.\n2. Touch sensitivity is not up to the mark.\n3. The SAR value could be higher. As a result I suffer mild headache following a phone conversation which did not happen in my Nokia and Samsung phones. So using ear phones could solve the problem.\n4. Battery consistency is extremely bad. I use my phone few mins to talk in a day, Check few mails and WhatsApp for few mins. Overall a very minimal usage and yet the battery lasts for only around 6-8 hours with full charge.\n5. The case covers and screen guards are not widely available outside. It's very expensive online. I can as well get another phone for price of a case cover. I have been visiting shops in my locality since a month.\n6. Camera quality is just OK.\n7. PPI is less compared to the moto g1. So image quality appears less crisp.\n8. Looks like cheap plastic used for back case cover. Not sturdy as 1st gen. So the back case can easily break.\n\nPros:\n1. Good deal for this price. I got it just lesser than 10k for an offer.\n2. Bigger screen is an advantage and disadvantage at times.\n3. Not much lags and hangs till date.\n4. Front Stereo speakers are just great.\nUltimately a good deal for this price."

            "desc": "I purchased this phone for my younger brother. This is his first Android phone ever.\n\nWhat I like about Moto G is that Motorola is giving a very balanced phone at a very nice base price. It has all the essentials one would absolutely want from an Android phone but it doesn't cost an arm and a leg.\n\nThe biggest problem with Android is that it gets slow over time. I don't know if that will happen with Moto G also or not as this is yet to be seen. This is an inherent Android problem and not of this hardware because Windows Phone based on same hardware such as Lumia 730 works really fast.\n\nWith the Android problem aside, this phone is good enough for anyone. It comes with a really good and sharp screen at near Retina Display quality with 1 GB RAM which is enough in Android for light use with 2, 3 apps running in background. At fresh boot with nothing installed this phone had only 370 MB RAM left which is something I find bad. The OS and Motorola bundled services are eating too much RAM and very less is left for user's own apps.\n\nThe camera is a standard 8 MP camera. It takes good pictures in well lit conditions. I haven't been able to test low light picture quality.\n\nAudio quality from earphones or Bluetooth handsfree is also fine.\n\nIt is big due to a lot of bezel around the screen. Motorola needs to reduce this in Moto G 3rd generation. Also, 5\" screen is too much. A 4.5\" screen size with higher PPI or AMOLED screen which further reduces battery consumption which is what I would recommend. No need to give gigantic screen sizes, if you want that, launch another phone between Moto G and Moto X. Keep Moto G at 4.5\" screen size as not everyone wants a gigantic phone.\n\nI purchased a Sandisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSD card for this phone as it is good enough to keep music, pictures and videos. I only keep apps in the phone memory.\n\nThe battery could have been better. Android is anyway not good with battery life.\n\nI highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a good enough and fast Android phone at a justified price."

What I observed is that this product is ultimate with all features which a 20K and above mobiles are providing at a price of 13K.\nPros: 1. Huge internal memory of more than 13 GB in 16 GB. 2. Excellent photos 3. Best User Interface (even a child can handle the features). 4. Can handle even the hardcore games like Real Racing 3 without any issues. 5. External memory with a capacity of upto 32 GB. 6. Dual speakers with good output. I installed mx player, a free app from playstore through which the sound is mind blowing. 7. Direct access to google drive, google photos. So we can have cloud store of more than 15 GB of data.\nCons : 1. No NFC 2. Battery capacity of 2070 mah could have been a little higher. If we use wifi or play games, battery life is around 6 to 8 hours. Otherwise approx 16 hrs.3. No USB cable provided. Not even screen guard is provided with the product. 4. No file manager. I had to install a free app called ES file explorer which is a very EXCELLENT one.\nFinally, the service of flipkart is appreciated. Within 2 days, I got the product. Immediately on unboxing and inserting SIM, all recent software updates got installed. Really nice. Best buy for the price tag. You will definetely like the product. Go for it."

I have ordered the product on 12th Oct 2014, it was delivered on 13th Oct because I have opted for \"Flipkart First\" subscription for Rs 500/- a year.\n\nWhen I opened the package, first thing that strikes is mobile has a scratch guard on it which doesn't have the logo of Motorola which you normally get when you purchase a product in a sealed pack condition. I have purchased Moto e and couple of my friends have purchased Moto G from Flipkart but all had that logo on the scratch guard. Which means I had been provided a refurbished product which someone might have returned.\n\nIt was not at all expected from Flipkart, when we are rooting for them against some foreign biggies, they shouldn't fool their customers like this. If you really want to sell refurbished product then you better list it out on your website.\n\nWhen I contacted their Customer Care in the middle of night after identifying the fraud, instead of immediately taking the replacement request all they did was take the request for a call back from their technical team. While today on 14th Oct when I again contacted them, another executive placed the replacement request immediately.\nSince I have already subscribed for the in a day delivery, the least I'm expecting is they provide a brand new product in a day which is 14th Oct or latest by 15th Oct afternoon.\n\nHowever, here onwards I would think twice before ordering anything from Flipkart.\nThere is no need to hold a \"Big Billion Day\", just give us good offers and good service and stop cheating.\n\nHoping to get a brand new product \"In a Day\".\n\n- A Pissed Off Customer"

The phone is fast. Touch has a little bit of problem. The only drawback is that the battery is poor. Even though 2070mAh sounds pretty cool and fancy but the battery hardly lasts 12 hours.

You wont even notice the drop in pixel density !\n\nThe 5 inch screen is really good.\n\nI cannot boast about the phones I've owned over the days, but from the Experience that I have using phones that belong to my friends , I can tell you that If you are looking for a phone below 15,000.

            "desc": "I just got my Moto G 2nd gen phone yesterday from flipkart, and I am loving it. Let me tell you that I just upgraded from a Sony W8 which I have been using for last 3 years. So my jump was pretty huge. From Android 2.1 to Kitkat. 128mb ram to 1GB, and a lot of other features. I also intend to keep this phone as long as the previous one.\n\nI loved the kitkat version and since Moto G would be one of the first phones to get the Android L upgrade coming this month, I am more excited.\n\nDisplay : Screen is amazing. Pretty clear, and resolution is perfect. Brightness is not a matter of concern.\nPerformance : Based on one day i would say much, but the screen toggle and app opening has been pretty smooth. Games like Asphalt 8 ran quite decently.\nWifi and my 2G worked well, giving good speed for net usage. I was happy with it. touch is also smooth. Felt no lags yet.\nCamera: well I lost interest in phone cameras some time ago. It is not that great, but not bad too. The settings look very mediocre, and they could have had more features I guess.\nFront camera was quite decent. I took a few good selfies with it.\nMusic: The sound is a bit disappointing even with the dual stereo speakers. The headphones are also very normal, and the earpiece don't fit well in my ears.\nStorage : 16 gb internal memory of which 12.79 gb is for user. I have used up 3 gb for apps already, but another 9gb free is quite good. Also have a 32 gb expandable external slot.\nBattery: I charged till 100 and used wifi continuously for 14 hours till it drained out completely. Then I started charging again and its taking quite some time. Well its a new battery too. But I have o wait before i comment more about battery here.\nThe charger is a single piece which i didnt like, unlike the usb to micro usb connector types.\n\nDoesnt come with other accesories like tv connector etc like old mobiles did, but I never used them anyways. Neither did they feel obliged to add in one extra shell. We have to pay almost 1k extra for that.\n\nBut all in all I am impressed with the phone, as I am guessing its performance is in par with some of the higher end phones, with double or triple its price.\n\nReceived the phone from Flipkart without much hassle in 2 days.\n\nUpdate after 3 days :\n----------------------------\n\nThe performance of the phone is just awesome. I have been playing games like Asphalt 8 for the whole day and it seldom hangs for a moment or show lags. But it does heat up, but I think that is to be expected.\n\nBut the battery is a great disappointment. Candy Crush 'crushes' it in 3-4 hours itself. With other games like Asphalt and Temple Run, it does give some more, but still you can expect only about 6 hours and around. Otherwise you get a whole day if you are not so active on the phone with wifi. Wifi drains the battery too.That's a bit of a disappointment in the battery side. Battery-saver switches off wifi on its own. For a person like me who buys a new phone once in 4-5 years, I think battery is a prime criteria. So taking off a star.\n\nCalls are clear and decent. Internet is fast. Screen is smooth."

I received it yesterday, I found this phone to be very good. All the praises everywhere around about the resurgence of Motorola and the positive reviews were the reasons for me to opt for the 2nd gen Moto G (and my budget too :P). And I must say, even after such huge expectations, I'm not disappointed. No need for me to delve into the specifications, as Flipkart has summarised them very well. Till now, I haven't found any problems worth writing about. But there's just one problem with Android Kitkat (it's not a con of this phone, mind it). You cannot set the default memory for your bluetooth transfers to your external SD card. All the files are occupying the internal storage, and I can't even move the files later to the external SD card (I'm using Androzip file manager). This is the only con that I found till now. Everything else is great. Highly recommended for those who want to buy a smartphone under 15k. :)"

Look: There is no remarkable change from the previous moto g in overall but the addition of duall speaker in front makes the phone looks like moto e but look more premium.\n2. Performance: If u used the moto g 1st gen then there is no difference in performance since both have same processor and ram but the slight upgrade in the display size (0.5 inch) makes the 2nd one better in our experience.\n3. Camera: Here is the big difference from the first gen.moto. the rear cam is equipped with 8mp autofocus camera but no image stabilizer. But moto g 2 takes descent foto in outdoor and good image in low light also. The front cam is 2mp cam and it is quite good for video calling but not that good for selfie.\n4. Battery: Here is the down point of the 2nd gen from the 1st one. If u used the phone with 3g on and display always on with surfing or listening song the battery will last only for 7 hrs from full charged to hit 5%. But it is not that bad because we hardly use phone like that. But I tested myself to know the performance. For normal users with some surfing, listening some songs, talking with girlfriend and playing some casual game the battery will last for almost a day. Due to having bigger screen I expected this from the battery as u know guys.\n5. Gaming Performance: The moto g 2 can also handle all the present HD games just like the previous one. I tested MC4, NFSMW, Asphalt 8, Fifa 14, Dead trigger 2 and Nova 3. All games run quite smooth without seeing noticeable frame drop. Due to having sharp and crisp 720p display and deliver descent viewing angle u will find comfortable playing HD games in this Phone.\nFinal verdict: If u r hardcore gamer and camera lover but don't want to burn a hole in ur pocket then This device is specially for u. It is much better than the other mid range phone from Sony Samsung HTC since those phone's price will fall nearly on 20k with the same specs. I experience Xiaomi mi3 myself which deliver premium specs and performance but can't promise the after sale service like OS upgrade repairing etc. Besides Xaiomi phones have some issues which are so frequent in many of their phone but not all like heating problem losing signal etc."

            "desc": "I am posting this review after using the phone for 11 days. Had placed order on 9th Sep in First Day Launch Offer and received the order on 10th (as promised In a Day delivery, Rs. 90 Extra). I am ok with Rs. 90 extra cost for such an assured delivery in a day. So as usual Flipkart at its best. I am a happy & satisfied consumer of Flipkart till date.\n\nHonest Review of the Device: A smartphone which has capacity to handle multitasking with nice Camera, Sound & UI. Though there are some cons too.\n\nPROS - 1. Good UI, touch is awesome, better than Samsung Galaxy Grand or Micromax Canvas. I liked the launcher and the bright inbuilt wallpapers which is not like cheap androids. It has a class. Four Star.\n2. Sound system is awesome. I liked the sound system if you have a headphone with ear-bud. The Bass/treble/Vocal/Bass Punch modes are fabulous. Five Star.\n3. Camera is too good with the price range. I have used Lumia 720/Galaxy Grand, compared to these it has advanced features. Secondary camera can capture nice Selfie. Four Star.\n4. First time user of Kitkat version of Android. Its a very light OS compared to JB. No hang/lag observed during regular operation/accessing internet. Though I am not crazy for Games, though basic games (Temple Run2, Crazy Grandpa, Rail Rush, Asphalt Bike runs smooth). Four Star.\n5. Keyboard is just awesome. Kitkat OS has some good featured Keyboard. You can just drag the word you want to type, it will fetch it automatically. This feature is best while travelling/walking. Five Star.Four Star.\n6. Connectivity is good and dont have any problem with it. Both SIM works perfect together. Four Star.\n7. Speaker output is perfect with two front speakers. Four Star.\n\nCONS - 1. Battery is average, no so good backup like Nokia. If you use Wifi/3G for more than two hours a day, it drains fast. Though in 2G it gives you good life. I need to make frequent calls/sms for 8 hours in a day which is not an issue with the device. Three Star.\n2. Heats up a little bit while charging, but do not pay attention to it. Its a minimum heat which generates like many other Androids like Samsung/HTC/Micromax/Xolo/Xiomi MI3 etc. while charging. Three Star.\n3. The Headset which is given inside the Box is very normal and with low quality. Two Star.\n4. No Data cable is given inside the box, its only a Socket charger. Two Star.\n\nHope the review will be helpful all the buyers who are planning to get it.\n\nI would say, GO FOR IT, its the BEST ANDROID (Kitkat) PHONE IN RANGE OF 13K."

SATISFIED with the delivery.\n\nBut the offers that were for the launch day buyers were actually ridiculous. Not of much work for majority. Anyway...that's not important.\n\nLets come to the phone performance-\n\n1. Camera- 8/10\n\n+Very good picture & video quality, good slow motion video recording, flash also good. Low light photos are equally good for the flash. photos and videos can be made in full dark also. use the flash as a torch also using downloaded torch app or cleanmaster app's widget.\n\nFront camera is also very good.\n\n-But after zooming not that much picture clarity.\n\n2. Display- 9/10\n\n+5 inch screen very attractive and display quality also good. Gorilla glass protection helps very much. screen protector is not must for that.\n\n-The screen guard provided was not set good. very bad.\n\n3. Game- 8/10\n\n+Every game I tried works quite good. games like gta vice city, fifa 14, max payne, asphalt 8 etc.\n\n-But Graphics can be set maximum to 60-65% range for flawless performance. Otherwise the game cant be played for lag (checked only for gta vice city). But its not that much problem as upto 60-65% range the graphics quality is good enough. and the fifa14 stopped several times after tapping 'tap to continue'. I had to reinstall it once and the next time it got fixed automatically.\n\n4. RAM- 10/10\n\n+No LAGS normally.\n\n5. Looks- 10/10\n\n+Very good looking phone. REALLY! both from front and backside.\n\n6. Sound- 7/10\n\n+Good sound quality.\ncall sound is also very loud.\n\n-But in some cases (for specific songs or games) its not that much loud. but OK.\nearphone doesn't go with the phone itself, but OK.\n\n7. Network- 9/10\n\n+No network problem till now. Used Vodafone and Airtel.\nBoth Airtel and Vodafone 3G worked well.\n\n8. Battery- 5/10\n\n-For normal usage like a bit gaming, some camera use, calls, sms, some gps it will give 8-10 hours back up with auto brightness on while not using the phone, I think. But if you use continuously, I think it will not give you more than 2-3 hours backup. I checked for full brightness and much camera use and gaming that it reduce the battery very quickly. Not tried the internet connectivity that much till now.\n\nHave ordered a power bank worth Rs. 749!\n\nN.B.:\nThe charger I received worked for one day only and then stopped working. does not charge. totally useless. But for me its just nothing problematic because I have same chargers from before as its a very common charger. For most people it wont be a problem. But those who doesn't have those from before, they'll definitely face problems and will have o buy a charger.\n\nBut I think its a special case that the charger didn't work. It'll work for most of the others, I think.\n\nIn all, its a good impressive product and keeping aside the battery issue its a good buy in this range.\n\nRecommended- 7/10\n\nHappy Shopping :-)"

DESIGN\nI found the design to be bit confusing because while using phone something i end up holding it upside down. i beilve there should be some logo on the front up side too.\n3. BATTERY\n2070mah . That might average while seeing in number but let me tell you battery backup is quite amazing . you wont have any issues regarding the battery backup . beileve me .\nonly bad thing about battery is that it takes way too much time to charge ..(idk the exact time but its little higher than samsung mobiles of this battery capacity)\n4. CHARGER\nYes. It do get hot after using . maybe charger is manufactured to work for foreign country plugs and thats why it gets heated here in India ( coz they have added an extra plug on top of the charger)\n5. NO USB CABLE.\nThat's quite annoying coz you have to remove back cover always and use a card reader >:O.\n6. CAMERA.\nQuality of camera is superb .. It shoots amazing pics but the interface you see on the camera is 6 MP . if you change it to 8 MP, then dont get full interface of the screen while taking pics .(but that really doesnt matter and doesnt effect resolution and clearity).\n7. SPEAKERZZZZZZ\nWell This is one of the biggest issue with this phone .. phone is not at all loud enough so that you can hear .. will watching an youtube video in your room with your ceiling fan on , you won't hear even a single word .\n8. HEADPHONES.\nHeadphones provided with set are really annoying to ears as they are also not so loud + they really hurt after about 30 min of use . (BUT if you use any other headphones liike philips , jbl or samsung ; they work really nice and very loud).\n\nOne More Thing .. I own an White coloured phone which looks way much better than black one .\nbut white colour is more prone to stuffs like dust , ball pen ink etc but dont worry they get easily removed on hard rubbing ..\nI would recommend to buy black phone if you are not much interested in showing off but let me tell you . The kind of look you get while holding a white phone is amazing .\nI Beileve black phone only suits with comapnies like Iphone coz they got glassy back panel.\nAnd At Last , i found the flip covers and back covers to be very expensive . 1700 and 800 respectively (Review Dated 18-Sep-14)"

Internal Memory of moto E also expendable.\nNo file manager provided so I can not found to send voice clip or song by Bluetooth.\nConnectivity is major problem.can not catch weak tower , while my other Samsung and Intex handset don't loose tower of same service provider (BSNL) so using net is being headache sometime.\nAs phone is made in China there is no difference in configuration with Xiaomy or Gionie etc. No regional language except Hindi is supported so can not read this language in fb, website etc. This type of problem is not in Samsung.\nHeadphone is worst and China brand.charger is OK.\nIn short if you want to by Moto then Moto E is worth for money then Moto G just double price."

The screen response and viewing angles are awesome\n3. Run totally Lag Free\n4. Pure Android experience with guaranteed future updates\n\nCons,\n1. it heats when you run games and some big applications\n2. Battery backup is below average, If you use 2G continue then it gives backup for 7-8 hrs on 3G 5-6 hrs only on WIFI its slight better but not as expected from Motorola\n3.

Excellent display - The screen is crisp and all colours look lively. You won't complain about the screen at all.\n2. The Stereo Speakers - Great sound quality, better than the earlier gen. of Moto G, you would definitely enjoy playing games and watching videos.\n3. The Camera - Good camera, fast focusing, great flash. Overall the camera is really good at this price point.\n4. Updates - Motorola has already confirmed that this phone would get the Android L update, so chill :'D\n5. Build Quality - The curved back gives an awesome feel to your hands and makes it easy for you to hold.\n6. Battery - I basically used my phone for browsing (45 min), Games (20 min), Watching videos (20 min), social messaging (25 min) and listening to music for 2 hrs..And surprisingly, I got battery backup of 20hr+..So it's great, at least for me.\n\nCONS:\n1. The camera could have been better in terms of sharpness. But it won't be a deal breaker for you.\n2. The RAM and Processor can be a problem for some of the people\n\nAt the end, I would suggest you guys to buy this phone if want a nice stylish phone at this price + a branded and reliable company like Motorola.

So guys whos charger is getting heat up while charging kindly get it change from flipkart.\n\nCamera performance is much much better than the old Moto G.\n\nWhile Playing games it never hangs so I can say the processor is also good as compare to all the samsung phones having 1 GB or Ram in that it hangs while playing game. I even played asphalt 8.0 and it is working great.\n\nRegarding the look and feel I cant keep myself away. I just love holding on my hand its very light.\n\nIf you come to the screen resolution you cannot say that its 720P or 1080P until you go through the Specification. The content is sharp and clear.\n\nThe sound is very loud and clear, even while attending a call or making a call there is no noise disturbance, the word spoken is very clear to me as well as to the receiver. Even the headphone sound is very loud and clear.\nWhile talking I didn't find any network drop.\n\nLast but not the least Apple user don't waste your money on such product whose cost is 6 times more and giving 2012 specification."

First Impression is the Last Impression - The speed, the hand-feel and the buttery touch will make you smile the moment you switch it on. The big screen is indeed a wonderful update to the good ol' Moto G 1st Gen\n\n2. Setting you up - This phone configures/personalizes all your stuff within minutes. Google is indeed biased towards its product.\n\n3. Camera - I am a photographer, and trust me, though people may start comparing this phone with its immediate competitor Micromax Canvas Nitro (which has a 13 MP & 5 MP camera), I would say don't get wooed by megapixels. This phone's camera has a pretty decent sensor.\n\n4. Memory too less - Is it? Well, technically yes. 1 GB is definitely not a pro in this multitasking world. But for users like me out there, who love to spend time more on social media, news, comics, magazines and other similar things, this phone will not disappoint you.\n\n5. Battery - A small problem indeed since now you have a powerful screen to touch with the same 1st Gen battery. However, with the right apps and usage (and I don't mean you won't play games or not browse the internet), you can pretty much make it last for 24 odd hours.\n\n6. Storage - Looks pretty decent to me. I am never going to cross 48 GB (16 GB + 32 GB MicroSD) anyway.\n\n7. Size, bulkiness, weight - This is a very light, slim and easily-comes-in-the-pocket phone. I have short fingers, so I got to use both hands for operation.\n\n8. EDGE/Wi-Fi - Can't really update you on 3G, but EDGE and Wi-Fi experience has been good so far.\n\nI got it on 9th September. Still a new user, and hence will keep sharing my experiences here in the days to come. However, I would strongly suggest you to buy this over any other phone in this range."

Coming to the specifications of the Moto G 2nd Generation:\n\n1.The box contains accessories like the charger and the headphones (not worth it). Use headphones like Sony, JBL, etc, the music is really superb. The charger is not a USB mounted charger. So please ensure to have your own USB cable for data transfer.\n\n2.The phone is very slim compared to the earlier Moto G and it is very light in weight when thinking of any other 5\" smartphone.\n\n3.The looks and design of the phone are worth appreciating. The Clear Black Body with the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and the Black Matt finish at the bottom, feels to keep it in hand for hours and hours. The resolution of the screen is HD.\n\n4.The display of the phone is very crisp and sharp, the wide angle display is also good. the pixel density is 294 ppi.\n\n5.The phone has 2 speakers, on the front and the output of the sound is very loud and clear. The sound is very high when compared to the sound of the previous version of Moto G.\n\n6.And now the most awaited moment for all the Moto G 2nd Generation buyers, the Motorola team has come up with a variant launched in India, having 16gb internal memory and expandable memory slot upto 32 gb.\n\n7.The camera quality is way way way way way way .... better than the previous version of the Moto G. The 8 mp quality is really good in the natural light and above average in the indoors. The front facing camera is decent with a 2 mp. The video resolution is HD.\n\n8.The advantage of buying this phone is that the Google has already announced that it would be having the next Android Update of LOLLIPOP, Android L for this phone. It comes with the Kitkat version of 4.4.4 and with no pre-loaded apps like the other smart phones other than two security applications of Motorola.\n\n9. The processor is an improved version compared to the previous version, it comes with a Snapdragon 400 chipset and a quad core 1.2 Ghz. The phone does not lag playing the games like asphalt 8, Dead Trigger, Nova 3 etc. There is no extreme heating when playing these high graphic games. The phone gets little warm, which normally would happen.\n\n10.It has a led notification light for all the notification lovers,\n\n11.The disappointment comes when the battery is considered, the battery is same 2070 mah, which should had been at least 2500 to 2700 mah. The only cons of this phone, but as far as an android phone is concerned, we all travel with our chargers and power banks. So its not a big concern.\n\n12.All people concerned about the care centers for Motorola, it has got its centers in all most all states\n\nSo, overall I would conclude, the best priced phone for a STOCK Android phone along with the delivery of the Flipkart makes it a SURE SHOT BUY.\n\nThank you Google and Motorola.... and Flipkart ..."

The new model has a display larger than the old model by 0.5 inches but with the same screen resolution. The 5-inch 720p display on the new Moto G produces good colours and has satisfactory viewing angles. The larger screen with the same screen resolution means a lower pixel density, but practically, there is little difference for a naked eye to notice.\n2. Improved cameras: The Moto G (2nd generation) comes with enhanced cameras. The megapixel count on the new Moto G has been upped from 5 megapixel to 8 megapixel for the primary camera, and 1.3 to 2 megapixel for the front camera. I remember telling people in review of the original Moto G earlier this year that the front camera is okay only for video calling, but not for selfies. But now Motorola has filled that gap with the new model.\n3. Additional storage: A significant improvement in the second-gen Moto G is that it offers expandable storage. The addition of a microSD card slot in the second-gen Moto G indicates that Motorola took the feedback seriously. The original Moto G was criticised for not offering additional storage. The company recommends to use a microSD card of not more than 32GB.\n4. Dual speakers: Unlike the old Moto G that came with a speaker grill at the back, the new Moto G has dual speakers at the front that produce fairly loud sound in a normal room environment. However, in a noisy atmosphere, it may not sound as powerful. But with earphones plugged in, the phone produces excellent audio results.\n5. Cheaper: Motorola in its new Moto G has upped the specs on many fronts, but what it has not increased is its price - in fact, the phone gets slightly cheaper. The new and improved Moto G (16GB) comes at a price of Rs 12,999, which is Rs 1000 cheaper than its predecessor. (The company has not yet launched the 8GB varaint of the new Moto G.)"

It is reasonably priced with the quality of the phone is.\n\nThe Pros:\n1) 5 inch Screen which is very easy to handle and it is really needed with today's usage of bigger screen, also the screen is Corning Gorilla Glass, which is essential in todays rough treatments with our Phones....lol..\n2) Phones Camera (8 MP as primary and 2 MP as Front for Selfie), it shoots really awesome pics with good resolution of 1280 X 720 and also the Video as well. Front camera works really great with better and brighter pics.\n3) Speakers, Dual speakers works really great. The sound is crispy and loud from both the speakers and when used the headset really good and entertaining which will keep you busy listening to music for hours.\n4) Light Weight of the phone makes it really easy to handle and its really compact and easy to use with one hand operation (of course u cant play games using one hand) but yes.\n5) Dual Sim slot, and very big addition of this phone is its Memory Card expansion slot, which is like a BOON to these category of models of phone with Premium Brands.\n6) Better phone in compact size compared to other 4.7 inch screen phone also against its predecessor models of Moto G and Moto X.\n\nThe Cons:\n1) Biggest and Baddest Con if i say is its Battery Usage, its really a Power Greedy phone (The reason power greedy because last night i charged the phone with 80% and went to sleep keeping the phone beside me, and in the morning when i woke up and saw the battery level is showed me 10% remaining (i slept for almost 6 1/2 hours) so you can imagine the consumption of power is made in those unused hours in the night.\n2) The Headset model provided with the phone are really obsolete ones. Everybody wants those noise cancellation with ear buds Headsets. Its really a cheap move made in Motorola quality (well we are even priced likewise), anyone can buy a new separate headsets with those noise cancellation ear buds and which will cost you around 1000 bucks, well it can be compromised.\n3) Hmmm....(thinking).........will get back once i find another one......\n\nBUT overall a good phone to buy for those budget conscious people out there.\nThe wait was worth it and i am really satisfied with the product if i compare it with the price i paid..\n\nEnjoy the phone....somethings can be compromised as no phone is perfect and every phone has their own drawbacks but....its good....."

Editing my rating from 5 to 0. Below was my initial review when I bought it.\n\nI have been using a phone which was costlier with less features. I can certainly feel the difference. This review is after a days use.\n1. Looks: Stylish. The front cover ruins the style. I feel like removing it. Apart from that, the finishing is good. Reasonable weight. The speaker protrusions look ugly. Those could have been in the sides. 4.5/5\n2. Screen: Looks good. Gorilla alright. Feather touch sensitive. Not sure why Google increased half an inch. I liked Moto G for this. 4.5/5\n3. Usability, memory management: No problems so far. With facebook, facebook messenger, chrome, google plus, hangouts, angry birds etc running, I still have 300mb free memory.\n4. Audio: Sound is good. Quality not deserving a 5 star rating because I hear some grains. 4.5/5\n5. Video: Expected Full hd videos to lag. But they played just fine. 5/5\n6. OS: I miss a smaller font and a better resolution. But a better resolution and a better battery would make it Moto X.\nGoogle Now is awesome. But have to open it and click the record button to record voice. But voice recognition is amazing. No FM recording or call recording. 4.3/5\nBattery performance: Practice every conservation methods like reducing brightness, turn off wifi/data when not in use, motorola assist, and you should be fine for 20-24 hours.\nCamera: Back cam is superb! So is the front. Misses photo modes.\nPackaging: Small neat package. An earphone, a charger inside. They could have given a free back cover and a cleaning cloth IMO.\n\nAltogether, Job well done by Google."

Booked it on the 6th at midnight and got delivered on 9th (due to holidays and the craphole iam living in). Great effort from flipkart, and about phone,.. You wont get a descent phone with all these features from a reliable company at this rate.. MOTO is a trust. Thats what it makes different from other chinese or Indian manufactures.\n\nPhone is excellent. 5'' display above the 4.5'' of moto g. slightly lower ppi. but u wont recognize with ur naked eyes. CRISP, SHARP and Vibrat but not oversaturated..\n\nPremium buit. Thin, and u have to hold it in ur hand to feel it.. just awesome..\n\n2 Stereo speakers out in front.. provides cristal clear sound without any distortion at max volume..\n\nAttention Grabbing look. seriously. Expecially the black one..\n\nThe only problem was I felt was The Charger provided in the pack is crap. earphone is OK, but not in-ear. Battery backup is kind of low.. but lasts a day for me without any problem in normal usage.. CAM is ok.. 8mp cam provides descent clarity images..which also suports panorama, HDR, and 1080p video and slowmotion..\n\nI recomend this phone for everyone who need a budget phone from a great company.. Dont go for the chinese over this.. they wont last long and u will regret later.. (happend to me)"

Flipkart has refunded me the entire amount. But my misfortune, that particular model is out of stock in Flipkart. So I waited for almost one week and Moto G 2nd Gen launched on the last Saturday. Without any doubt I ordered it on the first day and as always Flipkart delivered it to me within no time.\n\nSo regarding the service of Flipkart, its always 5/5.\n\nNow coming back to Moto G, awesome phone. The first look itself is stunning, great finish and very much handy. Although the screen size is 5 inch, it doesn't feel big on your hands. The build quality is excellent. The looks are better than Asus Zenfone 5.\n\nAs of now I have installed most of the apps that I use frequently and the phone is not lagging. The screen is ultra clear. The camera is good. 8MP is providing a good clarity and even the front cam too. The battery back up is pretty good. Infact the battery backup is far better than Asus Zenfone 5.\nThe front speakers are a great advantage on the new Moto G. Its loud and clear. The signal strength and wifi capturing is better compared to Zenfone 5.\n\nSo I dont regret now. Moto G 2nd Gen is far better than Asus Zenfone 5. Although the Asus UI is better. But Moto G is already updated to latest KitKat version. (preinstalled)\n\nThe dual sim functionality is good and the micro sd card slot is definitely a breakthrough compared to the Moto G 1st Gen.\n\nOverall I will give 5 out of 5 for the new Moto G."

Design- Outstanding look..with a sleek back cover and it is easy to hold in both hands( one or both). You must fill that it worth far than it's original price. I prefer the black one..coz it looks fabulous with such a big screen.\n2. Performance- Actually I am searching a phone which have the capability of doing multitasking with smoothness and I bet you that till now it has all those which will give you a proper satisfaction.\n3. Camera- I must say that it is the thing which makes me WONDER..because I heard reviews before I order. So I knew that it has a very optimized and cool camera with flash. I found it so easy because you can simply click on anywhere on the screen to capture photos. I have also testes the it with flash and I saw that it is very good.\n4. Sound- Moto G2 has dual speakers in FRONT which will give you a fabulous soothing experience. While you play any game,videos the sound will not be pampered by your hand.\n5. Others- It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor which give you a lagfree experience of playing games and doing multitasking. I installed Asphalt 8 and my experience was superb.\nThank you Flipkart and Motorola for delivering and making me happy. :)"

It drains out much faster than the previous version and other android phone in this range. If it could have been a bit better this could have been easily a sensation in android phone market.\nThe other which I could highlight is, it dint come with a data cable but that something I think we can live with.\n\nOverall,If you can live with the battery issue this phone is worth every single penny."

Accessories included Charger And Earphones. Earphones looks quite cheap. The quality of sound is not that good also. they look like some 300rs cheap earphones Except that the phone looks very stylish and feels very comfortable in hands.\n\nPros:\n1. It looks very good, display is very nice, bright and bit high saturated colours looks great. Videos looks amazing. As the display is of 5 inches, youtube videos looks great and websites show complete content, you dont have to scroll up and down too much.\n\n2. I have noticed that speakers are quite improved from older moto g, voice is very loud and crisp, voice doesnt get crack even if you play a high pitched noisy video on full volume. sound is very stable.\n\n3. It comes with 4.4 kitkat preinstalled. each and every application runs very smoothly even if you have many application running in the background, it doesnt even show 1% lag in scrolling or running any app. I downloaded asphalt 8 in this phone and it runs very very smoothly.\n\n4. Camera on this device is of 8 megapixel. and secondary camera is of 2 megapixel, i must say both the cameras works brilliantly. Hdr mode really works good. i have made a skype call to my friend and outgoing video was really good as my frnd told. i have took many selfies which are quite good looking and doesnt show any lack of quality.\n\n5. Voice calls were very clear and sharp. the audio quality was very good and noise reduction works seemlessly. The people with whom you are talking to can hear you clearly in a noisy environment.\n\n6. Again the main advantage in this new moto g is sd card support, which is amazing. you can use the whole internal memory of phone for installing games and applications and your videos and audio files can be stored in sd card which is ofcourse a great advantage.\n\n7. I have charged this phone 4-5 times till now and it doesnt get heated up. it stays cool even if you play games along with charging. Although it is not suggested to run heavy applications with charging, but who cares lol.\n\nCONS:\n1. At first i would say, motorola should consider that the earphones that they are giving with this phone should be good as the headphones are not good, and the sound quality of earphones are not good at all.\n2. As soon i turned this phone on, i have connected the device with my wifi to check for software updates n more but whenever i check for updates it says. \"Cant check for updates right now, Try later\" I think there must be some server error of anything.\nThats it. i couldnt find anything more as a drawback of a negative point to my experience.\n\nSo, i would say the phone is really good. looks smart, stylish with great performance and all the new features. Motorola guarantees the update of L android platform which will be released by google in future."

Multiple visits to the service centre (They were really not good) and calls to Motorola and Flipkart were of no use (They simply suggested me to visit the service centre again). I'm left to live with the fact that the button can fail any time. Also, i feel buying the phone on the launch day was a mistake, since the first phones off the assembly tend to have slight problems which get fixed later. I'm left jealous with the quality of my friends' Moto Gs construction.\n\nAmazing smartphone from Motorola, that too just at 13k! Finally upgraded from my Motorola Defy+, the experience on the Moto G is much more fluid than on my old phone.\nPros:\n1. The screen is sharp and even though it seems huge, its pretty compact for its size.\n2. Everything runs smoothly and snappily. No lag whatsoever (so far).\n3. The inclusion of a microSD card slot was a big plus for me, as i could transfer everything without even using Moto Migrate, which by itself is a great feature.\n4. Camera is a 8MP unit, but low light photos aren't very good. But hey, for this price point it's really great.\n5. Another big plus is the bloat-free KitKat.\n6. For those concerned about SAR, the SAR values for this phone are below the DoT recommendation.\nCons:\nNothing so far, (hopefully) won't find any. One thing to mention is non-removable battery, but it's easy to live with.\nSo the 2nd gen Moto G ticks all the boxes this time, I was really surprised to see the price of this phone."

I like its vividness.. Seriously my Mi3 didn't had that colour punchiness that this moto g have.....Also the Asus zenfone screen is comparatively less vivid..My friend own it.. No problems with the screen\n\nPerformance:-\nCAMERA:- Never expected that quality from a 13k phone, my canvas 2 colors' 8mp camera was a lot better than this at 8k.. Zenfone 5 has better camera than this one.. The images appear blurry and lost focused.. The mi3 camera is very good.\nGAMING:- This is the place where it hits the sweet spot.. It is lil bit better in gaming than Zenfone 5 but no way it could beat Xiaomi Mi3.. You can play any high end game on medium graphics setting without a lag but on high graphics setting it will tend to miss a frame or two..\n\nSPEAKERS AND HEADSET:- These are loud but while listening on the highest level of sound , they seem to be cracking a little bit.. So they are better than the competition at this price but not the best... And dont even dare to compare them with HTC's stereo speakers.. HTC's speakers are way too superior to those..\nHeadset output is good but here also nothing beats my HTC Desire 820...\n(I own a sennheiser , skullcandy titan ,Skullcandy Ink'd 2, Mi ear phones and Creative ep 630 sony MDR-XB30 ..So I do have a little bit of knowledge and experience..)\n\nCALL CLARITY AND \"SAR\" VALUE:-\nThe call clarity is good but not excellent.. The best call clarity among the mobiles I used until now is from HTC Desire 820...\nWhen I bought the phone, the SAR values mentioned on flipkart website were 0.55 and 1.01 W/Kg at body and head and suddenly after 2-3 days they changed them and increased the values on their product page.. And I was UNABLE TO LOCATE THE SAR VALUE ON THE BOX AS WELL AS PRODUCT, WHILE ITS MANDATORY FOR THE MANUFACTURERS TO MENTION THE SAR VALUE ON PRODUCT ITSELF ACCORDING TO INDIAN REGULATIONS..\nI bought that phone for my dad as my dad have strong affection for Motorola...\n\nI feel that this is a downgrade to previous moto G in terms of the QUALITY. My 2-3 friends own gen 1 moto G and boy it feels way too superior to use than this cheap quality product.\nI have owned Mi3 and now I understood that really XIAOMI is the best in cheaper phones...Mi3 no way feels cheap like this phone.\nFIRST TIME BUYERS WILL FIND MOTO G 2nd gen TO BE ON PAR, but ones who have habit of changing mobiles like me, will find this phone to be costly in terms of what it offers power wise.. It should have been 11999 as compared to the competition.\nEnd result:\n\nFriends if you want a real smartphone experience then please take a look at YU Yureka or go for Zenfone 5 so that you will save 3-4k and also will get more value for money.. And lastly, if you have a strong affection for stock android, then go with Moto G 2nd gen.\nUPDATED 20/02/2015:\n\nAfter the LOLLIPOP UPDATE, the battery seems to be lasting more, or should I say far more... The entire experience after the update is very very good... But as compared to Mi3, its still below par.. But as Mi3 sale is over and there is no competition except Zenfone 5, it seems moto g2 is the ultimate winner..Currently, I own a HTC Desire 820 and moto g2 is being used by my dad.. Now he is satisfied with the mobile after the update...\nOther than that, the phone is smooth as butter.. Lollipop ruined my nexus 7 but this moto g seems to be a very good handler for the lollipop update..\nSo overall, I will strongly recomment others to go with moto g2 ( after lollipop update only) if they are looking for proper balance of performance, design and software.. I am in love with lollipop... Waiting for it on my HTC desire...\nThank You for reading this.. Will update soon as per the experiences.."

All other keys open some other application during charging.\nConnectivity: The calls gets disconnected abruptly in-between. Sometime the other person says, he is not able to hear anything.\nSpeakers: The headset is not up to the mark, even the loud speakers are very bad. Call quality is not good and cannot hear anything.\n\nFinally I am very dejected with the battery performance. for the kind of processor speed they have given a absolute useless battery.

Therefore, one doesn't feel it is only a 13k phone.\n\nPros: everyone knows. Personally I feel the best phone with some features which can be corrected.\n\nCons: Ram is 1 GB, it may not sound like a con but if you add the used RAM and free RAM the total comes to 852 MB which far less than 1GB (1024 MB). (of which more than 350 MB is already occupied RAM so you only get 500 MB for your own use)\n\nI have checked lava iris x1, Rs. 7600 phone provides you with 950 MB in 1GB of RAM so what happened with Moto G. Last time they sold more than a million Moto G so for calculating how many GBs they are saving by saving just 100 MB on one phone.\n\n1000000 x 100 MB = 100000 GB of money (one lakh GB of money)\n\nSecond thing:\n\nThe scroll down of Moto G is like empty.\nThe most basic thing which one uses is the \"profile\". like the phone sound is on General, Silent, Meeting, Outdoor but it does not have that option neither in the scroll down section nor in the settings.\n\nNormally if you go to the setting => Profile => General, Silent, Meeting or Outdoor and choose one of them to customize the settings.\n\nBut in Moto G, Setting=> Sound. No option for Profile, general, Silent, meeting or outdoor. (Big problem)\n\nSo the only solution is press the on/off button then change the sound to \"silent\", \"vibrate\" or general\" but no option to edit these settings.\n\nI am playing Asphalt 8 on this phone. Good but sometimes it crashes. So not so good.\n\nTherefore, overall it\u2019s a 5 star rating phone comparing the price it is available at. Only thing they need to do is correct the problems mentioned above."

I was originally not happy with the 5inch screen, having always preferred the smaller sub 4.5inch phones, but I quickly started to enjoy the extra screen real estate.\n\nMy biggest issue with this phone has been the miserable battery performance. I gave it a full charge soon as it arrived and that charge lasted about 6 hours of usage!\n\nAnyway, I then disabled GPS, reduced screen brightness, and now a full overnight charge is lasting me about 7-8 hours at normal usage. It takes only 3 hours to go from 100% to 50% with usage of 3g, a few phone calls, some whatsapp messaging. That just cannot work for my lifestyle!\n\nThe other issue that I noticed right from day 1 which frightened me is that the touchscreen sometimes does not respond. Particularly when it is plugged in to charge. Not just does it not respond, but it acts very erratic. So when it is having such an episode, it presses buttons randomly, does not recognize your finger, etc. I have had this happen about 3-4 times in the first two days, though it has not done that again since.\n\nIt worries me to have a phone showing such serious issues right in the first week of usage, and makes me not trust it as a device that is so important in my life. I dont know if it is my particular piece that is defective, or whether this model itself is a bad choice.\n\nI am returning my phone for these reasons. 8 hours of battery is just not acceptable for a lifestyle on the move. Too bad, coz I was starting to really like the phone. :("

Motorola should pump up its quality function to avoid such issues. I bought this phone with lot of excitement but was disappointed completely. Since I got 2 replacement i.e. I used 3 different devices, I find it hard to digest this as a one-off case.\n\nMy experience is as follows:\n\nLot of positive reviews on the Flipkart and numerous media reports strongly recommending MOTO G (2nd Gen) as one of the best devices in its price range made the purchase decision easy for me.\n\n22nd Sept | Phone reached us in no time through the one-day delivery option.\n\n29th Sept | The phone worked flawlessly for a week before the display conked off. Immediately a return/replacement request was filed with Flipkart which was addressed and accepted immediately and the replacement phone reached us the very next day. The return request was denied at this point in time by Flipkart and I cannot complain as this is mentioned on the Moto G page on the Flipkart site.\n\n7th Oct | During a week\u2019s usage of this phone I could sense that the screen has yellow tint on the screen. In fact it was clearly evident when the brightness was set as low. The screen display quality was really disturbing specially because the phone is known for its display. Hence I again requested for a replacement/return. This was also entertained and accepted immediately. Plus I was offered to return the phone by the Flipkart executive, however I chose to give them another chance hoping that this is a one-off case. I asked for a 2nd replacement.\n\n20th Oct | Since I was travelling, I requested Flipkart executive to deliver the 2nd replacement on the 20th. . When I got it I noticed the similar issue on the screen of this device as well. Only difference being that on the previous phone, the entire screen was yellow and in the 2nd replacement phone the bottom half of the screen was yellow. I browsed through the net to find that the issue is known and lot of people are facing it.\n\n21st Oct | I requested for an immediate return and finally pick-up happened on the 22nd and soon after I got the refund as well. Thanks to Flipkart for the same.\n\nI give a rating of 1 on the scale of 5 to the phone. However good a phone may be, may have the best of specifications, a single factor can still make it unusable.\n\nFlipkart gets 4 out of 5. You could have got 5 on 5 if you have provisions of entertaining requests on the delivery date and time. I faced a lot of issues when the 2nd replacement was in transit and I contacted your team through phone/mail multiple times to request for a delivery before a certain day and your team gave nothing but false promises. I have noticed that you team has no influence over this and product gets delivered only as per the schedule mentioned on the website. This is an area where you can improve."

I ordered Moto G 2nd Generation on Mon, 8th Sep'14 for my wife as her birthday gift on 18th Seo'14. At the time of placing order it showed that faster delivery is not available in Guwahati, so, will be delivered by 19th. I requested Filpkart to deliver it on or before 18th. Thanks to Mr. Kethan S from Customer Support of Flipkart who confirmed me that it will be delivered on or before 18th.\n\nFlipkart kept their promise and Delhivery delivered the Moto G2 on 18th Sep'14. Many many thanks to Flipkart and Delhivery.\n\nNow coming to the product, Motorola has done a great job. The build quality is solid. I felt the premium build quality of Moto G2 as soon as I hold it. The curved design made it one step ahead from the other brands.\n\nPros:\n1. Good build\n2. Good camera\n3. Good battery life (I charged it upto 100% yesterday and still its showing 60%)\n4. Gorila Glass helps to use it without screen protector\n6. Great display\n7. Front speakers are loud n clear\n8. No network or call drops\n9. Around 12GB available internal memory\n10. 5 inch easy to handle with Single hand\n\nCons:\n1. Stock Android 4.4.4 UI is not that much user friendly compared to Samsung Touchwiz UI. So many user friendly shortcuts and options are not available which can be found even in low budget Samsung Android phones.\n2.The charger provided with this phone is very weak and takes a bit amount of time to charge the phone.\n3. Headphone is not good.\n4. File Manager not found. You have to download third party file manager app.\n5. My phone color is black and I got white colored headset. It looks awkward when I wear headset.\n6. FM radio not playable through the speakers\n\nOverall a great buy from Flipkart for dual sim functionality, great looks and functionality at budget. Since it has few cons... I gave four stars"

I bought another charger to see if atleast that charges faster but no, the serial bus of MOTO G is different.\n3. Functionality issues like shortcuts, UI are way too primitive than 2012 phones, you really have to click 2-3 times to get to one feature\n4. Data transfer is a big pain, firstly they dont give you a USB chord to transfer songs/videos and to make it worse, if you use your normal cable, there is a big issue of drivers and copying files is very unpredictable\n\nI have requested for a product return as I invested 13000 so that i dont have to keep this phone plugged to my charger ALL DAY.\n\nMy advice :- dont buy, go for equal range Sony/Samsung phones, atleast they have some set standards"

Almost Pure Android 4.4 with assured upgrade to Android L. (Redmi1s is modified JB)\n2. The back panel is way better/comfortable to hold and has better grip and looks premium.\n3. Forget the dimensions, the MotoG2 looks slimmer and elegant.\n4. The camera quality(do not go with resolutions only) is definitely a BIG PLUS over its 1st Gen.\n5. The dual speakers front speakers are amazing when you listen to video/audio.\n6. Though both Redmi 1s/ MotoG2(Lenovo) are Chinese - but the latter looks way better when you flaunting.\n7. Bigger screen - and the screen looks real nice.\n\nCons.\n1. The battery could have been a little better to support the big crisp display and heavy usage of users these days.\n2. \"Ok Google\" is not there directly like in MotoX/Nexus5.\n\nRest 'features' (not specs) are more or less same. So if the criteria is ONLY budget - its Redmi 1S but if its look & feel/ built quality, etc - its HELLO MOTO G2 all the way!!"

Speakers deliver Loud sound but quality is not good. Camera inspite of being 8 Megapixel is not delivering any better pictures.So, to me Moto G ( 2nd Gen. ) is not better in any aspect then original Moto G. Only good thing happened is addition of Micro sd slot.\nOh! battery back up is average. Overall a good phone but could have been much better. In future I shall be skeptical in buying a product from Motorola because being a Chienese Co. now. it has inherited what all the Chinese companies are known for, to compromise with quality for keeping the costs low and margins high."

So, no need to say about its extremely great looks.(good to show off)\n\nUsability is very smooth like cake walk, up to now no lags or hangs etc\n\nThe Screen Resolution is Very good. I expected that the increase in screen size may pixelate the screen... But the resolution is as clear as mirror.\n\nStereo Speakers: This is a game changer under this price range\u2026Really an excellent addition. The speakers make the design to look sexier\u2026\n\nCamera Clarity also very good.

I will never buy a single product from flipkart neither i will recommend you guys to any of my friend.\nLet me tell you this glamorous story to you.\n\nI order Moto G (2nd Gen) my Order\n\nIn exchange offer I was happy for the amount that I was getting for my old phone so I decided to go for it. I was eligible for two offers\n\n1) Exchange offer\n2) HDFC bank card 5% off\n\nI booked the order, delivery was schedule for 11th June. Now the problem starts here\n\n1) I didn't got name and no of a person who was going to deliver the product. Flipkart always use to send the name and no of person who will be delivering the product.\n\n2) Delivery boy gave me call right from my door step, and asked me for my old mobile,\nwhich was with me and i was at office it was around 4:00 (Approx time) i asked him to deliver at 6:30. he said he cant deliver again and suggested me to collect it from the Andheri Hub at Sona Udyog. and also mentioned it is open 24*7\n\n3) I went to hub at 7:15PM and there I came to know the order has been RTO, customer care has cancelled my order without consulting me.\n\n4) Then there was a blame game, CC said it has been cancelled from Logistic side, and logistic team said it has been cancelled by CS, and also said delivery vendor is new they may not be aware of process.\nI am aware if I reschedules the delivery for 3 time then the order gets RTO.\n\nThis is ridiculous and not accepted at all. I have formatted my old phone now have to do all rework on it. How can you guys cancel the order without consulting me. Even after showing my readiness to go to hub for collecting my order by myself. this is mental harassment.\n\nAnd now i have to burn my blood at your customer care no.\n\nHope you guys take corrective measure for it."

The performance was acceptable and the phone was working fine.\n\nOn 5th June when i connected the charger to charge my phone, there was a spark in the phone port for charging and then i was not able to charge the phone. The phone was working fine, but it was not getting charged.\n\nA call to to the Motorola Call Center yielded a 9000 Rs Quote for complete replacement of motherboard.\n9000 Rs to replace the motherboard on a 11000 Rs phone?\n\nAre you people offering MOTO G at good prices, so that you can take out all our money in the after sales and services??\n\nPlease give me solution for this."

But 10 days I found the product to be defective where the performance of the mobile was too slow. When i raised the concern to Flipkart, then they gave me a solution to Switch Off and Switch On the mobile and then charge the mobile (crazy solution ever). I tried it but no use still the performance was slow. Later after 20 days I found that the Dual speakers was sometime not working which was a begger concern for me. After I raised a request for Return / Replacement, without any discussion they rejected my request which was such Unprofessional way of dealing with the customer. Simmilarly again I raise 2 more request for the replacement but no one has reached me on my mobile and hence i lost 10K buying this defective product."
